Liquid DOM is a monorepo for WebGPU liquid-glass rendering, React bindings, Three.js integration, React Three Fiber integration, and the renderer-agnostic layout engine used by the higher-level APIs.

The packages are split by integration layer. Use the lowest-level package that matches the renderer you own, or the higher-level React packages when you want declarative layout.

## Packages

| Package | Purpose | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@liquid-dom/core`](./packages/core) | Imperative DOM-backed scene graph, WebGPU renderer, reusable glass core, and layout classes. | You want direct control over the scene graph or you are building an adapter for another renderer. |
| [`@liquid-dom/react`](./packages/react) | React 19 bindings for the layout and glass APIs. | You want to describe glass UI in React and let `LiquidCanvas` own the canvas, or you need a headless scene for another renderer. |
| [`@liquid-dom/three`](./packages/three) | Adapter for compositing liquid glass over Three's WebGPU renderer. | You already render a Three WebGPU scene and want liquid glass as a post-composited layer. |
| [`@liquid-dom/r3f`](./packages/r3f) | React Three Fiber bridge built on `@liquid-dom/three` and `@liquid-dom/react`. | You use R3F with Three's WebGPU renderer and want React liquid-glass UI over the scene. |
| [`@liquid-dom/layout`](./packages/layout) | Renderer-agnostic layout engine. | You need SwiftUI-style measurement and placement without any renderer dependency. |

## Package Relationships

`@liquid-dom/layout` is independent. `@liquid-dom/core` uses it for the layout subpath but also exposes a lower-level imperative scene graph and WebGPU renderer. `@liquid-dom/react` wraps the layout classes from `@liquid-dom/core/layout` in React components. `@liquid-dom/three` hosts the reusable WebGPU core inside a Three WebGPU renderer. `@liquid-dom/r3f` combines the React and Three packages for React Three Fiber.

## Installation

Install the package that matches your integration target. Package-specific READMEs list the full install command including peer dependencies.

```sh
pnpm add @liquid-dom/core
pnpm add @liquid-dom/react react react-dom
pnpm add @liquid-dom/three @liquid-dom/core three
pnpm add @liquid-dom/r3f @liquid-dom/react @react-three/fiber react react-dom three
pnpm add @liquid-dom/layout
```

## Repository Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm -r build
pnpm --filter @liquid-dom/layout test
pnpm --filter @liquid-dom/core test
pnpm --filter @liquid-dom/react test
```

Use the package READMEs for package-level build and test commands.

## Browser And Runtime Requirements

The liquid-glass renderer requires WebGPU. DOM-backed `Html` content also requires the experimental HTML-in-Canvas API, which is currently available only behind Chrome's Canvas Draw Element flag: `chrome://flags/#canvas-draw-element`. The implementation uses `<canvas layoutsubtree>` and canvas paint events to copy live DOM content into GPU textures.

The DOM and React packages can build scene graphs in any browser-like environment, but rendering requires a browser with `navigator.gpu`; rendering DOM-backed content additionally requires the Chrome flag above. Three integrations require Three's WebGPU renderer, not WebGLRenderer.
