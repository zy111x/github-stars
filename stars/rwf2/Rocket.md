Rocket
======

Rocket is an async web framework for Rust with a focus on usability, security, extensibility, and speed.

#\[macro\_use\] extern crate rocket;

#\[get("/<name>/<age>")\]
fn hello(name: &str, age: u8) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}

#\[launch\]
fn rocket() -> \_ {
    rocket::build().mount("/hello", routes!\[hello\])
}

Visiting `localhost:8000/hello/John/58`, for example, will trigger the `hello` route resulting in the string `Hello, 58 year old named John!` being sent to the browser. If an `<age>` string was passed in that can't be parsed as a `u8`, the route won't get called, resulting in a 404 error.

Documentation
-------------

Rocket is extensively documented:

-   Overview: A brief look at what makes Rocket special.
-   Quickstart: How to get started as quickly as possible.
-   Getting Started: How to start your first Rocket project.
-   Guide: A detailed guide and reference to Rocket.
-   API Documentation: The "rustdocs".

Documentation for the `master` branch is available at https://rocket.rs/master and https://api.rocket.rs/master.

Documentation for major release version `${x}` is available at `https://[api.]rocket.rs/v${x}`. For example, the v0.4 docs are available at https://rocket.rs/v0.4 and https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4.

Finally, API docs for active git branches are available at `https://api.rocket.rs/${branch}`. For example, API docs for the `master` branch are available at https://api.rocket.rs/master. Branch rustdocs are built and deployed on every commit.

Examples
--------

The examples directory contains complete crates that showcase Rocket's features and usage. Each example can be compiled and run with Cargo. For instance, the following sequence of commands builds and runs the `hello` example:

cd examples/hello
cargo run
