# ClewdR

ClewdR is a Rust proxy for Claude — both Claude.ai and Claude Code — serving native Claude and OpenAI-compatible endpoints from a single binary.

It runs as one static executable on Linux, macOS, Windows and Android, with a Docker image available, and typically uses `<10 MB` RAM, starts in `<1 s`, and weighs `~15 MB`.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release for your platform from GitHub. Assets are named
   `clewdr-<os>-<arch>.zip`, where `<os>` is one of `linux`, `musllinux`,
   `macos`, `windows` or `android`, and `<arch>` is `x86_64` or `aarch64`.
   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://github.com/Xerxes-2/clewdr/releases/latest/download/clewdr-linux-x86_64.zip
   unzip clewdr-linux-x86_64.zip
   chmod +x clewdr
   ```
2. Run the binary:
   ```bash
   ./clewdr
   ```
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8484` and enter the admin password printed to the console.

### With Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name clewdr \
  -p 8484:8484 \
  -v clewdr-data:/etc/clewdr \
  ghcr.io/xerxes-2/clewdr:latest
```

Images are published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Use `:latest`, or pin a release with `:v0.13.1`.

Mount something at `/etc/clewdr`, or the generated passwords are lost on every recreate. The config lives there as `clewdr.toml`, with logs under `log/`.

Read the passwords from the container:

```bash
docker logs clewdr | grep Password
```

Or set them yourself, which is easier to automate. Any config key can be set as an environment variable by upper-casing it and prefixing `CLEWDR_`; the value is read as the type that key holds, so `CLEWDR_PASSWORD=12345` is the string `12345`. Booleans accept `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `on`/`off` and `1`/`0` in any case.

```bash
docker run -d --name clewdr \
  -p 8484:8484 \
  -v clewdr-data:/etc/clewdr \
  -e CLEWDR_PASSWORD=your-api-password \
  -e CLEWDR_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password \
  ghcr.io/xerxes-2/clewdr:latest
```

The image already sets `CLEWDR_IP=0.0.0.0` so the port is reachable, and disables the update checks, since an image cannot replace its own binary.

## Adding Cookies

ClewdR needs at least one Claude.ai cookie before it can serve requests.

1. Export your Claude.ai cookies (e.g. via browser devtools).
2. Paste them into `Claude` → `Submit Cookie`, one cookie per line, and submit.
3. `Claude` → `Cookie Status` then shows each cookie's state and remaining quota.

The `Config` tab covers everything else: the API and admin passwords, an outbound proxy, retry limits, and rules for skipping cookies. Server settings such as IP and port need a restart to take effect; the rest apply on save.

If you forget the password, delete `clewdr.toml` and start the binary again. Docker users can mount a persistent folder for that file.

## Connecting a Client

All paths below are relative to `http://127.0.0.1:8484`.

| | Claude.ai | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|
| Native Claude | `/v1/messages` | `/code/v1/messages` |
| OpenAI-compatible | `/v1/chat/completions` | `/code/v1/chat/completions` |
| Model list | `/v1/models` | `/code/v1/models` |
| Token counting | — | `/code/v1/messages/count_tokens` |

Streaming works on every endpoint. The API password is printed to the console on startup, separately from the admin password.

SillyTavern:

```json
{
  "api_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8484/v1/chat/completions",
  "api_key": "password-from-console",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
}
```

The model-list endpoint above returns the ids ClewdR currently accepts, including a `-thinking` variant of each.

Any other OpenAI-compatible client — Continue, Cursor and the rest — works the same way: point its API base at `http://127.0.0.1:8484/v1/` and use the API password as the key.

## Building from Source

The frontend compiles to WebAssembly into `static/`, which the server then serves. That directory is gitignored, so it has to be built first, or `cargo run` starts a server with no UI. `cargo xtask` handles the ordering:

```bash
cargo xtask check     # report on the required toolchain pieces
cargo xtask build     # release build of the frontend and the server
cargo xtask dev       # both, with frontend hot reload, on :3000
cargo xtask lint      # clippy over every valid feature combination
cargo xtask fmt       # format (always via nightly)
cargo xtask ci        # everything CI runs
```

Building the frontend needs `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `cargo binstall trunk`. Running `cargo xtask` itself needs nothing.

Two gotchas if you bypass xtask. Formatting must go through **nightly**, because `.rustfmt.toml` uses nightly-only options that stable silently ignores.

`--all-features` also fails: `embed-resource`/`external-resource` and `portable`/`xdg` are mutually exclusive pairs enforced in `build.rs`.
