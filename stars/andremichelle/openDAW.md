### Prepare, Clone, Installation, and Run

openDAW tries to avoid external libraries and frameworks. The following is a list of the external libraries we currently
use in the web studio:

* [jszip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jszip) (for openDAW project bundle file)
* [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it) + [markdown-it-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-table) (
  for help pages)
* [d3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force) (for graph debugging)
* [soundfont2](https://github.com/Mrtenz/soundfont2) (for soundfont loading)
* [zod](https://zod.dev) (schema validation)
* [ffmpeg](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) (decoding/encoding)

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required for cloning the repository and managing submodules.
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) is required to create a certificate for developing with
  https protocol.
- [Node.js](nodejs.org) version **>= 23**. This is necessary for running the development server and installing
  dependencies.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) While Sass is handled internally during the development process, you will need to
  ensure you have the
  binaries available in your environment if used outside the build system.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [OpenSSL](https://openssl-library.org/) For generating local development certificates (), OpenSSL needs to be
  installed on
  your system. Most Linux/macOS systems have OpenSSL pre-installed.

### Clone

`git clone https://github.com/andremichelle/opendaw.git && cd opendaw`

### Installation

* `npm run cert` (only for the very first time)
* `npm run clean` (to revert to clean slate, removes all `node_modules` and `dist` folders)
* `npm install` (for the first time and after `npm run clean`)
* `npm run build` (for the first time and after `npm run clean`)
* `npm run dev:studio` | `npm run dev:headless` (start dev server)
* Navigate to https://localhost:8080 (port is important > cors sample api)

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions from developers, musicians, educators, and enthusiasts. To learn more about how you can
participate, visit our [Contribute](https://opendaw.org/contribute) page.

### What We Are Looking For:

1. **Offline desktop build (e.g., via Tauri) or a standalone installable PWA** — offer offline capability.
2. **Cloud-agnostic project storage** — a facade layer that lets users plug in different cloud services (e.g., Drive,
   S3, Dropbox) for projects and sample libraries.
3. **Live remote collaboration** — real-time session sharing and sync so multiple users can edit the same project
   concurrently.
4. **AI manual assistant** — an embedded agent that answers context-aware questions and guides users through features as
   they work.
5. **AI-powered stem splitting** — integrated source-separation to extract vocals, drums, and other stems directly
   inside the DAW.
6. **Import and Export** - Contribute every possible file format IO
