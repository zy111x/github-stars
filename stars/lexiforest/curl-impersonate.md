A special build of [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) that can impersonate the four major browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox(In progress). `curl-impersonate` is able to perform TLS and HTTP handshakes that are identical to that of a real browser.

`curl-impersonate` can be used either as a command line tool, similar to the regular curl, or as a library that can be integrated instead of the regular libcurl. See [Usage](#Basic-usage) below.

## Why?

When you use an HTTP client with a TLS website, it first performs a TLS handshake. The first message of that handshake is called Client Hello. The Client Hello message that most HTTP clients and libraries produce differs drastically from that of a real browser.

If the server uses HTTP/2, then in addition to the TLS handshake there is also an HTTP/2 handshake where various settings are exchanged. The settings that most HTTP clients and libraries use differ as well from those of any real browsers.

For these reasons, some web services use the TLS and HTTP handshakes to fingerprint which client is accessing them, and then present different content for different clients. These methods are known as [TLS fingerprinting](https://lwthiker.com/networks/2022/06/17/tls-fingerprinting.html) and [HTTP/2 fingerprinting](https://lwthiker.com/networks/2022/06/17/http2-fingerprinting.html) respectively. Their widespread use has led to the web becoming less open, less private and much more restrictive towards specific web clients

With the modified curl in this repository, the TLS and HTTP handshakes look *exactly* like those of a real browser.

## How?

To make this work, `curl` was patched significantly to resemble a browser. Specifically, The modifications that were needed to make this work:
* Compiling with BoringSSL, Google's TLS library, which is used by Chrome and Safari.
* Modifying the way curl configures various TLS extensions and SSL options.
* Adding support for new TLS extensions.
* Changing the settings that curl uses for its HTTP/2 connections.
* Running curl with some non-default flags, for example `--ciphers`, `--curves` and some `-H` headers.

The resulting curl looks, from a network perspective, identical to a real browser.

<small>
Notes:

1. Chromium-based browsers all share the same fingerprints, except for the `User-Agent` header and `sec-ch-ua-platform` header. They will not be updated unless this assumption changed. Use your own header if you need to impersonate `Edge`, `Chrome Android` etc.
2. The original Safari fingerprints in the upstream fork are [not correct](https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate/issues/215).
</small>

~~This list is also available in the [browsers.json](browsers.json) file.()~~ Needs to be updated.

## Basic usage

For each supported browser there is a wrapper script that launches `curl-impersonate` with all the needed headers and flags. For example:

    curl_chrome123 https://www.wikipedia.org

You can add command line flags and they will be passed on to curl. However, some flags change curl's TLS signature which may cause it to be detected.

Please note that the wrapper scripts use a default set of HTTP headers. If you want to change these headers, you may want to modify the wrapper scripts to fit your own purpose.

See [Advanced usage](#Advanced-usage) for more options, including using `libcurl-impersonate` as a library.

## Documentation

More documentation is available in the [docs/](docs/README.md) directory.

## Installation
There are two versions of `curl-impersonate` for technical reasons. The **chrome** version is used to impersonate Chrome, Edge and Safari.

### Pre-compiled binaries
Pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available at the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl-impersonate/releases) page. Before you use them you may need to install zstd and CA certificates:

* Ubuntu - `sudo apt install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-dev`
* Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS - `yum install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-devel`
* Archlinux - `pacman -S ca-certificates zstd`
* macOS - `brew install ca-certificates zstd`

The pre-compiled binaries contain libcurl-impersonate and a statically compiled curl-impersonate for ease of use.

The pre-compiled Linux binaries are built for Ubuntu systems. On other distributions if you have errors with certificate verification you may have to tell curl where to find the CA certificates. For example:

    curl_chrome123 https://www.wikipedia.org --cacert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

Also make sure to read [Notes on Dependencies](#notes-on-dependencies).

### Building from source

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### Docker images

> [!WARNING]
> New docker images added in this fork are work in progress.

Docker images based on Alpine Linux and Debian with `curl-impersonate` compiled and ready to use are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lwthiker/curl-impersonate). The images contain the binary and all the wrapper scripts. Use like the following:

```bash
# Chrome version, Alpine Linux
docker pull lwthiker/curl-impersonate:0.5-chrome
docker run --rm lwthiker/curl-impersonate:0.5-chrome curl_chrome110 https://www.wikipedia.org
```

### Distro packages

> [!WARNING]
> This is for the upstream project

AUR packages are available to Archlinux users:
* Pre-compiled package: [curl-impersonate-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/curl-impersonate-bin), [libcurl-impersonate-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libcurl-impersonate-bin).
* Build from source code: [curl-impersonate-chrome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/curl-impersonate-chrome), [curl-impersonate-firefox](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/curl-impersonate-firefox).

## Advanced usage
### libcurl-impersonate

`libcurl-impersonate.so` is libcurl compiled with the same changes as the command line `curl-impersonate`.

It has an additional API function:

```c
CURLcode curl_easy_impersonate(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *target,
                               int default_headers);
```

You can call it with the target names, e.g. `chrome123`, and it will internally set all the options and headers that are otherwise set by the wrapper scripts.
If `default_headers` is set to 0, the built-in list of  HTTP headers will not be set, and the user is expected to provide them instead using the regular [`CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER`](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER.html) libcurl option.

Calling the above function sets the following libcurl options:

* `CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION`
* `CURLOPT_SSLVERSION`,
* `CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`,
* `CURLOPT_SSL_EC_CURVES`,
* `CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_NPN`,
* `CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPN`
* `CURLOPT_HTTPBASEHEADER`, if `default_headers` is non-zero (this is a non-standard HTTP option created for this project).
* `CURLOPT_HTTP2_PSEUDO_HEADERS_ORDER`, sets http2 pseudo header order, for exmaple: `masp` (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).
* `CURLOPT_HTTP2_SETTINGS` sets the settings frame values, for example `1:65536;3:1000;4:6291456;6:262144` (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).
* `CURLOPT_HTTP2_WINDOW_UPDATE` sets intial window update value for http2, for example `15663105` (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).
* `CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPS`, `CURLOPT_SSL_SIG_HASH_ALGS`, `CURLOPT_SSL_CERT_COMPRESSION`, `CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_TICKET` (non-standard TLS options created for this project).
* `CURLOPT_SSL_PERMUTE_EXTENSIONS`, whether to permute extensions like Chrome 110+. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).
* `CURLOPT_TLS_GREASE`, whether to enable the grease behavior. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).
* `CURLOPT_TLS_EXTENSION_ORDER`, explicit order or TLS extensions, in the format of `0-5-10`. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).

Note that if you call `curl_easy_setopt()` later with one of the above it will override the options set by `curl_easy_impersonate()`.

### Using CURL_IMPERSONATE env var
If your application uses `libcurl` already, you can replace the existing library at runtime with `LD_PRELOAD` (Linux only). You can then set the `CURL_IMPERSONATE` env var. For example:

    LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 my_app

The `CURL_IMPERSONATE` env var has two effects:

* `curl_easy_impersonate()` is called automatically for any new curl handle created by `curl_easy_init()`.
* `curl_easy_impersonate()` is called automatically after any `curl_easy_reset()` call.

This means that all the options needed for impersonation will be automatically set for any curl handle.

If you need precise control over the HTTP headers, set `CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no` to disable the built-in list of HTTP headers, then set them yourself with `curl_easy_setopt()`. For example:

    LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no my_app

Note that the `LD_PRELOAD` method will NOT WORK for `curl` itself because the curl tool overrides the TLS settings. Use the wrapper scripts instead.

### Notes on dependencies 

If you intend to copy the self-compiled artifacts to another system, or use the [Pre-compiled binaries](#pre-compiled-binaries) provided by the project, make sure that all the additional dependencies are met on the target system as well. 
In particular, see the [note about the Firefox version](INSTALL.md#a-note-about-the-firefox-version).
