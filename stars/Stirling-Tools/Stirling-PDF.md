Stirling-PDF
============

Stirling-PDF is a robust, locally hosted web-based PDF manipulation tool using Docker. It enables you to carry out various operations on PDF files, including splitting, merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more. This locally hosted web application has evolved to encompass a comprehensive set of features, addressing all your PDF requirements.

Stirling-PDF does not initiate any outbound calls for record-keeping or tracking purposes.

All files and PDFs exist either exclusively on the client side, reside in server memory only during task execution, or temporarily reside in a file solely for the execution of the task. Any file downloaded by the user will have been deleted from the server by that point.

How to Use
----------

### Windows

For Windows users, download the latest Stirling-PDF.exe from our release section or by clicking here.

### Locally

Please view the LocalRunGuide.

### Docker / Podman

Note

https://hub.docker.com/r/stirlingtools/stirling-pdf

Stirling-PDF has three different versions: a full version, an ultra-lite version, and a 'fat' version. Depending on the types of features you use, you may want a smaller image to save on space. To see what the different versions offer, please look at our version mapping. For people that don't mind space optimization, just use the latest tag.

Please note in the examples below, you may need to change the volume paths as needed, e.g., `./extraConfigs:/configs` to `/opt/stirlingpdf/extraConfigs:/configs`.

### Docker Run

docker run -d \\
  -p 8080:8080 \\
  -v ./trainingData:/usr/share/tessdata \\
  -v ./extraConfigs:/configs \\
  -v ./logs:/logs \\
# Optional customization (not required)
# -v /location/of/customFiles:/customFiles \\
  -e DOCKER\_ENABLE\_SECURITY=false \\
  -e INSTALL\_BOOK\_AND\_ADVANCED\_HTML\_OPS=false \\
  -e LANGS=en\_GB \\
  --name stirling-pdf \\
  stirlingtools/stirling-pdf:latest

### Docker Compose

version: '3.3'
services:
  stirling-pdf:
    image: stirlingtools/stirling-pdf:latest
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    volumes:
      - ./trainingData:/usr/share/tessdata # Required for extra OCR languages
      - ./extraConfigs:/configs
#      - ./customFiles:/customFiles/
#      - ./logs:/logs/
    environment:
      - DOCKER\_ENABLE\_SECURITY=false
      - INSTALL\_BOOK\_AND\_ADVANCED\_HTML\_OPS=false
      - LANGS=en\_GB

Note: Podman is CLI-compatible with Docker, so simply replace "docker" with "podman".

### Kubernetes

See the kubernetes helm chart here

Enable OCR/Compression Feature
------------------------------

Please view the HowToUseOCR.md.

Reuse Stored Files
------------------

Certain functionality like `Sign` supports pre-saved files stored at `/customFiles/signatures/`. Image files placed within here will be accessible to be used via the web UI. Currently, this supports two folder types:

-   `/customFiles/signatures/ALL_USERS`: Accessible to all users, useful for organizations where many users use the same files or for users not using authentication
-   `/customFiles/signatures/{username}`: Such as `/customFiles/signatures/froodle`, accessible only to the `froodle` username, private for all others

Supported Languages

Customization
-------------

Stirling-PDF allows easy customization of the app, including things like:

-   Custom application name
-   Custom slogans, icons, HTML, images, CSS, etc. (via file overrides)

There are two options for this, either using the generated settings file `settings.yml`, which is located in the `/configs` directory and follows standard YAML formatting, or using environment variables, which would override the settings file.

For example, in `settings.yml`, you might have:

security:
  enableLogin: 'true'

To have this via an environment variable, you would use `SECURITY_ENABLELOGIN`.

The current list of settings is:

security:
  enableLogin: false # set to 'true' to enable login
  csrfDisabled: true # set to 'true' to disable CSRF protection (not recommended for production)
  loginAttemptCount: 5 # lock user account after 5 tries; when using e.g. Fail2Ban you can deactivate the function with -1
  loginResetTimeMinutes: 120 # lock account for 2 hours after x attempts
  loginMethod: all # 'all' (Login Username/Password and OAuth2\[must be enabled and configured\]), 'normal'(only Login with Username/Password) or 'oauth2'(only Login with OAuth2)
  initialLogin:
    username: '' # initial username for the first login
    password: '' # initial password for the first login
  oauth2:
    enabled: false # set to 'true' to enable login (Note: enableLogin must also be 'true' for this to work)

        useAsUsername: login # field to use as the username for GitHub OAuth2
    issuer: '' # set to any provider that supports OpenID Connect Discovery (/.well-known/openid-configuration) endpoint
    clientId: '' # client ID from your provider
    clientSecret: '' # client secret from your provider
    autoCreateUser: false # set to 'true' to allow auto-creation of non-existing users
    blockRegistration: false # set to 'true' to deny login with SSO without prior registration by an admin

There is an additional config file `/configs/custom_settings.yml` where users familiar with Java and Spring `application.properties` can input their own settings on top of Stirling-PDF's existing ones.

### Extra Notes

-   **Endpoints**: Currently, the `ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE` and `GROUPS_TO_REMOVE` endpoints can include comma-separated lists of endpoints and groups to disable. For example, `ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages` would disable both image-to-pdf and remove pages, while `GROUPS_TO_REMOVE=LibreOffice` would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups here.
-   **customStaticFilePath**: Customize static files such as the app logo by placing files in the `/customFiles/static/` directory. An example of customizing the app logo is placing `/customFiles/static/favicon.svg` to override the current SVG. This can be used to change any `images/icons/css/fonts/js`, etc. in Stirling-PDF.

### Environment-Only Parameters

-   `SYSTEM_ROOTURIPATH` - Set the application's root URI (e.g. `/pdf-app` to set the root URI to `localhost:8080/pdf-app`)
-   `SYSTEM_CONNECTIONTIMEOUTMINUTES` - Set custom connection timeout values
-   `DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY` - Set to `true` to download security jar (required for authentication login)
-   `INSTALL_BOOK_AND_ADVANCED_HTML_OPS` - Download Calibre onto Stirling-PDF to enable PDF to/from book and advanced HTML conversion
-   `LANGS` - Define custom font libraries to install for document conversions

API
---

For those wanting to use Stirling-PDF's backend API to link with their own custom scripting to edit PDFs, you can view all existing API documentation here, or navigate to `/swagger-ui/index.html` of your Stirling-PDF instance for your version's documentation (or by following the API button in the settings of Stirling-PDF).

Login Authentication
--------------------

### Prerequisites

-   User must have the folder `./configs` volumed within Docker so that it is retained during updates.
-   Docker users must download the security jar version by setting `DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY` to `true` in environment variables.
-   Then either enable login via the `settings.yml` file or set `SECURITY_ENABLE_LOGIN` to `true`.
-   Now the initial user will be generated with username `admin` and password `stirling`. On login, you will be forced to change the password to a new one. You can also use the environment variables `SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_USERNAME` and `SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_PASSWORD` to set your own credentials straight away (recommended to remove them after user creation).

Once the above has been done, on restart, a new `stirling-pdf-DB.mv.db` will show if everything worked.

When you log in to Stirling-PDF, you will be redirected to the `/login` page to log in with those default credentials. After login, everything should function as normal.

To access your account settings, go to Account Settings in the settings cog menu (top right in the navbar). This Account Settings menu is also where you find your API key.

To add new users, go to the bottom of Account Settings and hit 'Admin Settings'. Here you can add new users. The different roles mentioned within this are for rate limiting. This is a work in progress and will be expanded on more in the future.

For API usage, you must provide a header with `X-API-KEY` and the associated API key for that user.

FAQ
---

### Q1: What are your planned features?

-   Progress bar/tracking
-   Full custom logic pipelines to combine multiple operations together
-   Folder support with auto-scanning to perform operations on
-   Redact text (via UI, not just automated)
-   Add forms
-   Multi-page layout (stitch PDF pages together) support x rows y columns and custom page sizing
-   Fill forms manually or automatically

### Q2: Why is my application downloading .htm files? Why am i getting HTTP error 413?

This is an issue commonly caused by your NGINX configuration. The default file upload size for NGINX is 1MB. You need to add the following in your Nginx sites-available file: `client_max_body_size SIZE;` (where "SIZE" is 50M for example for 50MB files).

### Q3: Why is my download timing out?

NGINX has timeout values by default, so if you are running Stirling-PDF behind NGINX, you may need to set a timeout value, such as adding the config `proxy_read_timeout 3600;`.
