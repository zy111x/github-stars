# Takumi

Takumi is an **image rendering engine** written in Rust. The design is mainly inspired by [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), but with a focus on portability and performance (2-10x compared to next/og in [Image Bench](https://image-bench.kane.tw/)).

You can try out Takumi in [Playground](https://takumi.kane.tw/playground) without installation. Or [Quick Start](https://takumi.kane.tw/docs/) page for usage.

> [!NOTE]
> The Showcase section is now open! Share your Takumi-powered projects by opening a pull request to [showcase.ts](./docs/app/data/showcase.ts)!

## Why build a satori alternative?

- All in one. No need to output SVG then have [resvg-js](https://github.com/thx/resvg-js) rendering it again to output PNG.
- Inline layout support (display `block` or `inline`).
- RTL support.
- Tailwind CSS support out of the box.
- Variable fonts support.
- COLR font support (e.g. twemoji-colr).
- WOFF2 font format support.
- PNG, JPEG, WebP output support.
- WebP, APNG animation rendering support.
- Low latency video rendering with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) ([example](./example/ffplay)).

## Goals

- Takes your existing JSX components and drops them in, it should just work.
- Minimal binary size targets to run everywhere.
- Be the go-to library for image/animation rendering.
- Have a great developer experience.

## Showcase

- Takumi's Open Graph Image is generated with Takumi [(source)](./example/twitter-images/components/og-image.tsx).

- X Open Graph Image [(source)](./example/twitter-images/components/x-post-image.tsx).

- [shiki-image](https://github.com/pi0/shiki-image) Convert code snippets into images.
