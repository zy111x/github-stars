## Quick Start

> **Prerequisite:** [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai) installed.

### **Desktop (macOS + Windows)**
Download from [Releases](https://github.com/btriapitsyn/openchamber/releases).

### **VS Code**
Install from [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fedaykindev.openchamber) or search "OpenChamber" in Extensions.

### **CLI (Web + PWA)**
_requires Node.js 22+_

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btriapitsyn/openchamber/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
openchamber --ui-password be-creative-here
```

<details>
<summary>Advanced CLI options</summary>

```bash
openchamber --port 8080              # Custom port
openchamber --lan --port 3000        # Listen on LAN (0.0.0.0)
openchamber --ui-password secret     # Password-protect UI
openchamber startup enable           # Start at login as a native service
OPENCHAMBER_UI_PASSWORD=secret openchamber startup enable # Save service password env
openchamber startup status           # Show startup service status
openchamber startup disable          # Remove startup service
openchamber tunnel help              # Tunnel lifecycle commands
openchamber tunnel providers         # Show provider capabilities
openchamber tunnel profile add --provider cloudflare --mode managed-remote --name prod-main --hostname app.example.com --token <token>
openchamber tunnel start --profile prod-main
openchamber tunnel start --provider cloudflare --mode quick --qr
openchamber tunnel start --provider cloudflare --mode managed-local --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
openchamber tunnel status --all      # Show tunnel state across instances
openchamber tunnel stop --port 3000  # Stop tunnel only (server stays running)
openchamber connect-url --port 3000  # Add this server to OpenChamber Desktop
openchamber connect-url --server http://host:3000 --qr
openchamber connect-url --port 3000 --qr
openchamber logs                     # Follow latest instance logs
OPENCODE_PORT=4096 OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true openchamber                    # Connect to external OpenCode server
OPENCODE_HOST=https://myhost:4096 OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true openchamber  # Connect via custom host/HTTPS
openchamber stop                     # Stop server
openchamber update                   # Update to latest
```

`startup enable` snapshots your current environment into the native service so startup behaves like you launched `openchamber` from the same shell. This preserves provider tokens, PATH, SSH agent settings, and other CLI auth/config env vars. Use `--no-env-snapshot` if you want a minimal service env.

Connect to an existing OpenCode server:
```bash
OPENCODE_PORT=4096 OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true openchamber
OPENCODE_HOST=https://myhost:4096 OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true openchamber
```

Bind managed OpenCode server to all interfaces (use only on trusted networks):
```bash
OPENCHAMBER_OPENCODE_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 openchamber --port 3000
```

Expose OpenChamber itself on your LAN:
```bash
openchamber --lan --port 3000 --ui-password secret
```

Add this server to OpenChamber Desktop or another OpenChamber app:
```bash
openchamber connect-url --port 3000 --qr
```

If no OpenChamber server is running on that port, `connect-url` starts one before generating the link.

Headless/API-only setup for a remote machine:
```bash
openchamber connect-url --port 3000 --api-only --lan --server http://your-host-or-ip:3000 --qr --ui-password secret
```

This runs OpenChamber as an API-only server without the desktop app or browser UI assets on that machine, then creates a link for Desktop to import. `--lan` makes the server reachable from other machines. `--server` is the address Desktop should use.

When OpenChamber was started with `--lan` or `--host 0.0.0.0`, `connect-url` automatically uses a detected LAN IP instead of `127.0.0.1`. Use `--server http://host:3000` to override the advertised address, and include `--lan` when `connect-url` needs to start the server for LAN access.

Paste the printed `openchamber://connect?...` link in Desktop under Settings -> Remote Instances -> Direct Instances -> Import Link. The link contains the server URL and a client token. It does not enable browser UI password protection; use `--ui-password` when exposing a server beyond localhost.

<details>
<summary>systemd service (VPN / LAN access)</summary>

Run OpenChamber and OpenCode as separate persistent services — useful when you want to access your
dev machine over a VPN (e.g. Tailscale) or LAN without a Cloudflare tunnel.

**How it works:**
- OpenCode runs as its own service, binding only to `localhost`.
- OpenChamber connects to it via `OPENCODE_HOST` and `--lan` makes it reachable on your VPN IP.
- `--foreground` keeps the CLI process alive so systemd can track and restart it.

**`~/.config/systemd/user/opencode.service`**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=OpenCode Server

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=opencode serve --port 4095
Environment="PATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/sbin:/home/YOU/.local/bin:/home/YOU/.npm-global/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/ssh-agent.socket
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

> **Why set `PATH` and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`?**
> systemd user services start with a minimal environment — no shell profile is sourced.
> Without an explicit `PATH`, OpenCode won't find tools installed via Homebrew, npm, or `~/.local/bin`.
> Without `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, git operations over SSH (push, pull, clone) will fail because the agent socket isn't inherited.
> Adjust the `PATH` to match your own tool installation paths.
> `%t` expands to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (e.g. `/run/user/1000`), where most SSH agents write their socket.

**`~/.config/systemd/user/openchamber.service`**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=OpenChamber Web Server
After=opencode.service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=openchamber serve --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0 --ui-password your-password --foreground
Environment="OPENCODE_HOST=http://localhost:4095"
Environment="OPENCODE_SKIP_START=true"
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now opencode openchamber
```

OpenChamber will be reachable at `http://<your-vpn-hostname>:3000` from any device on your VPN.

> **Note:** `--host 0.0.0.0` is required to listen on all interfaces. The default
> bind address is `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). Use `--host <ip>` or
> `OPENCHAMBER_HOST=<ip>` to bind to a specific interface instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Available at `http://localhost:3000`.

**UI Password:**
```yaml
environment:
  UI_PASSWORD: your_secure_password
```

**Cloudflare Tunnel (optional):**
```yaml
environment:
  OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_MODE: quick # quick | managed-remote | managed-local
  OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_PROVIDER: cloudflare
```

For `managed-remote` mode, provide:

```yaml
environment:
  OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_MODE: managed-remote
  OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_HOSTNAME: app.example.com
  OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_TOKEN: <token>
```

For `managed-local` mode, optionally provide:

```yaml
environment:
  OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_MODE: managed-local
  OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_CONFIG: /home/openchamber/.cloudflared/config.yml
```

Managed-local path note: `OPENCHAMBER_TUNNEL_CONFIG` must point to a path inside the container user home (`/home/openchamber/...`). If your Cloudflare config references a credentials JSON file, that file path must also be accessible inside the container (mount with `volumes`).

### Reverse proxy notes

- For a complete reverse proxy setup guide, see [`docs/REVERSE_PROXY.md`](./docs/REVERSE_PROXY.md).
- Website docs source lives at `packages/docs/content/docs/reverse-proxy.mdx`.

### Tunnel behavior notes

- OpenChamber supports one active tunnel per running instance (port).
- Starting a tunnel with a different mode/provider on the same instance replaces the current tunnel.
- Replacing or stopping a tunnel revokes existing connect links and invalidates remote tunnel sessions for that instance.
- Connect links are one-time tokens; generating a new link revokes the previous unused link.

**Data Directory Permission Note:** The `data/` directory is mounted into the container for persistent storage (config, sessions, SSH keys, workspaces). Before running, ensure the directory exists and has proper permissions:

```bash
mkdir -p data/openchamber data/opencode/share data/opencode/config data/ssh
chown -R 1000:1000 data/
```

**SSH/Git:** If git push/pull fails, run `ssh -T git@github.com` in terminal.
