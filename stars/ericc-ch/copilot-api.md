# Copilot API Proxy

> [!WARNING]
> This is a reverse-engineered proxy of GitHub Copilot API. It is not supported by GitHub, and may break unexpectedly. Use at your own risk.

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/E1E519XS7W)

## Project Overview

A reverse-engineered proxy for the GitHub Copilot API that exposes it as an OpenAI and Anthropic compatible service. This allows you to use GitHub Copilot with any tool that supports the OpenAI Chat Completions API or the Anthropic Messages API, including to power [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7654b383-669d-4eb9-b23c-06d7aefee8c5

## Prerequisites

- Bun (>= 1.2.x)
- GitHub account with Copilot subscription (individual, business, or enterprise)

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

```sh
bun install
```

## Using with Docker

Build image

```sh
docker build -t copilot-api .
```

Run the container

```sh
docker run -p 4141:4141 copilot-api
```

## Using with npx

You can run the project directly using npx:

```sh
npx copilot-api@latest start
```

With options:

```sh
npx copilot-api@latest start --port 8080
```

For authentication only:

```sh
npx copilot-api@latest auth
```

## Command Structure

Copilot API now uses a subcommand structure with two main commands:

- `start`: Start the Copilot API server. This command will also handle authentication if needed.
- `auth`: Run GitHub authentication flow without starting the server. This is typically used if you need to generate a token for use with the `--github-token` option, especially in non-interactive environments.

## Command Line Options

### Start Command Options

The following command line options are available for the `start` command:

| Option         | Description                                                                   | Default    | Alias |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| --port         | Port to listen on                                                             | 4141       | -p    |
| --verbose      | Enable verbose logging                                                        | false      | -v    |
| --account-type | Account type to use (individual, business, enterprise)                        | individual | -a    |
| --manual       | Enable manual request approval                                                | false      | none  |
| --rate-limit   | Rate limit in seconds between requests                                        | none       | -r    |
| --wait         | Wait instead of error when rate limit is hit                                  | false      | -w    |
| --github-token | Provide GitHub token directly (must be generated using the `auth` subcommand) | none       | -g    |
| --claude-code  | Generate a command to launch Claude Code with Copilot API config              | false      | -c    |

### Auth Command Options

| Option    | Description            | Default | Alias |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| --verbose | Enable verbose logging | false   | -v    |

## API Endpoints

The server exposes several endpoints to interact with the Copilot API. It provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints and now also includes support for Anthropic-compatible endpoints, allowing for greater flexibility with different tools and services.

### OpenAI Compatible Endpoints

These endpoints mimic the OpenAI API structure.

| Endpoint                    | Method | Description                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | `POST` | Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. |
| `GET /v1/models`            | `GET`  | Lists the currently available models.                     |
| `POST /v1/embeddings`       | `POST` | Creates an embedding vector representing the input text.  |

### Anthropic Compatible Endpoints

These endpoints are designed to be compatible with the Anthropic Messages API.

| Endpoint                         | Method | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST /v1/messages`              | `POST` | Creates a model response for a given conversation.           |
| `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | `POST` | Calculates the number of tokens for a given set of messages. |

## Example Usage

Using with npx:

```sh
# Basic usage with start command
npx copilot-api@latest start

# Run on custom port with verbose logging
npx copilot-api@latest start --port 8080 --verbose

# Use with a business plan GitHub account
npx copilot-api@latest start --account-type business

# Use with an enterprise plan GitHub account
npx copilot-api@latest start --account-type enterprise

# Enable manual approval for each request
npx copilot-api@latest start --manual

# Set rate limit to 30 seconds between requests
npx copilot-api@latest start --rate-limit 30

# Wait instead of error when rate limit is hit
npx copilot-api@latest start --rate-limit 30 --wait

# Provide GitHub token directly
npx copilot-api@latest start --github-token ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

# Run only the auth flow
npx copilot-api@latest auth

# Run auth flow with verbose logging
npx copilot-api@latest auth --verbose
```

## Using with Claude Code

This proxy can be used to power [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/claude-code), an experimental conversational AI assistant for developers from Anthropic.

There are two ways to configure Claude Code to use this proxy:

### Interactive Setup with `--claude-code` flag

To get started, run the `start` command with the `--claude-code` flag:

```sh
npx copilot-api@latest start --claude-code
```

You will be prompted to select a primary model and a "small, fast" model for background tasks. After selecting the models, a command will be copied to your clipboard. This command sets the necessary environment variables for Claude Code to use the proxy.

Paste and run this command in a new terminal to launch Claude Code.

### Manual Configuration with `settings.json`

Alternatively, you can configure Claude Code by creating a `.claude/settings.json` file in your project's root directory. This file should contain the environment variables needed by Claude Code. This way you don't need to run the interactive setup every time.

Here is an example `.claude/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:4141",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "dummy",
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "gpt-4.1",
    "ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL": "gpt-4.1"
  }
}
```

You can find more options here: [Claude Code settings](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#environment-variables)

You can also read more about IDE integration here: [Add Claude Code to your IDE](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/ide-integrations)

## Running from Source

The project can be run from source in several ways:

### Development Mode

```sh
bun run dev
```

### Production Mode

```sh
bun run start
```

## Usage Tips

- To avoid hitting GitHub Copilot's rate limits, you can use the following flags:
  - `--manual`: Enables manual approval for each request, giving you full control over when requests are sent.
  - `--rate-limit <seconds>`: Enforces a minimum time interval between requests. For example, `copilot-api start --rate-limit 30` will ensure there's at least a 30-second gap between requests.
  - `--wait`: Use this with `--rate-limit`. It makes the server wait for the cooldown period to end instead of rejecting the request with an error. This is useful for clients that don't automatically retry on rate limit errors.
- If you have a GitHub business or enterprise plan account with Copilot, use the `--account-type` flag (e.g., `--account-type business`). See the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-github-copilot-access-to-your-organizations-network#configuring-copilot-subscription-based-network-routing-for-your-enterprise-or-organization) for more details.
