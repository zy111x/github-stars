## Quick Start

Getting started with VoidAuth is straightforward, the recommended approach is to add VoidAuth to a `compose.yml` file:

``` yaml
services:
  # ---------------------------------
  # Your reverse-proxy service here:
  # caddy, traefik, nginx, etc.
  # ---------------------------------

  voidauth: 
    image: voidauth/voidauth:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./voidauth/config:/app/config
    environment:
      # Required environment variables
      # More environment variable options can be found 
      #   on the Getting Started page.
      APP_URL: # required, ex. https://auth.example.com
      STORAGE_KEY: # required
      DB_PASSWORD: # required, same as voidauth-db POSTGRES_PASSWORD
      DB_HOST: voidauth-db # required
    depends_on:
      voidauth-db:
        condition: service_healthy

  voidauth-db:
    image: postgres:18
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: # required, same as voidauth DB_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker
    healthcheck:
      test: "pg_isready -U postgres -h localhost"

volumes:
  db:
```

After creating/updating the compose.yml file and filling in the required environment variables, run `docker compose up -d` and visit your `APP_URL` to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After VoidAuth starts for the first time, find the initial administrator username and password in the logs: `docker compose logs voidauth`. Use these credentials to log in and change the default username and password or create a separate user for yourself.

> [!TIP]
> Users are created by administrators on the Invitations page by creating a new Invitation, then sending the invitation link.

Please see the [Getting Started](https://voidauth.app/#/Getting-Started) page for setup details and configuration options.
