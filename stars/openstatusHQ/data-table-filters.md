## About The Project

This is a standalone data-table demo that we will be using within the [OpenStatus](https://openstatus.dev) dashboard.

![Data Table with Infinite Scroll](https://data-table.openstatus.dev/assets/data-table-infinite.png)

Visit [data-table.openstatus.dev](https://data-table.openstatus.dev) to learn more.

To make it not only more accessible for you to use, but also work on PoC/MVP with data-tables, we have started this repository. We will maintain it and add new examples over time.

It currently includes two main concepts:

- [data-table with simple pagination](https://data-table.openstatus.dev/default) (client-side filtering with zustand client state)
- [data-table with infinite scroll and click details](https://data-table.openstatus.dev/infinite) (server-side with URL state via nuqs)

The UI is heavily inspired by datadog and vercel log tables.

> [!NOTE]
> We are working on a [Guide](https://data-table.openstatus.dev/guide) to help you get started and not wild guess anymore.

More Examples:

- [OpenStatus Light Viewer](https://data-table.openstatus.dev/light) (UI for [`vercel-edge-ping`](https://github.com/OpenStatusHQ/vercel-edge-ping))

## BYOS (Bring Your Own Store)

We support a flexible adapter pattern for state management called **BYOS** (Bring Your Own Store). This allows you to:

- Use **URL-based state** with `nuqs` (default for `/infinite` and `/light` routes)
- Use **client-side state** with Zustand or React state (default for `/default` route)
- Create **custom adapters** for any state management solution

### Quick Example

```tsx
import { createSchema, field } from "@/lib/store/schema";

// Define your filter schema
const filterSchema = createSchema({
  regions: field
    .array(field.stringLiteral(["ams", "gru", "syd"]))
    .delimiter(","),
  latency: field.array(field.number()).delimiter("-"),
  active: field.array(field.boolean()).delimiter(","),
});

// Use with DataTableFilterCommand
<DataTableFilterCommand schema={filterSchema.definition} />;
```

See the [Guide](https://data-table.openstatus.dev/guide) for detailed documentation on BYOS, creating custom adapters, and more.
