# Remocn

remocn is a copy-paste component library for building videos in Remotion. Instead of writing every fade, wipe, and kinetic title from scratch, you `npx shadcn add` a polished primitive into your project and own the code. Built for solo builders and small teams who need a product demo video shipped today, not next week.

## Installation

Remotion is a prerequisite — set up a Remotion project first if you don't have one (`npx create-video@latest`). Then add any component from the registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @remocn/blur-reveal
```

## Why remocn

- **Remotion has no batteries-included component library** You either build every animation from scratch or copy snippets from blog posts. remocn gives you a curated registry of primitives and full scenes that just work.
- **Polished motion is hard** Easing curves, spring physics, transition timing - remocn ships components that already feel right, so you can focus on storytelling instead of tuning `interpolate()` calls.
- **You own the code** Components are copied into your repo (shadcn philosophy). No runtime dependency, no version lock-in, no black box - tweak anything you want.
- **Solo builders need demo videos fast** Compose a launch trailer, changelog clip, or feature walkthrough from prebuilt blocks in an afternoon.
