# Feditext

A free, open-source iOS client for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Glitch](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/), [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/), [Firefish](https://joinfirefish.org/), [Akkoma](https://akkoma.social/), and other Mastodon-API-compatible Fediverse instance servers.

Feditext is based on the [Metatext](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext) project, which has concluded and is no longer maintained. Feditext is updated with Mastodon 4 features and better support for non-Mastodon instances.

## Testers Wanted

If you are interested in joining the TestFlight group, please DM our official Fedi account [@Feditext@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Feditext), and follow it for announcements and release notes.

## Contributing Bug Reports

GitHub is used for bug tracking.
Search [existing issues](https://github.com/feditext/feditext/issues) and create a new one if the issue is not yet tracked.
Upstream issues can be referenced in the [archived project](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext/issues).

## Contributing Translations

Existing translations for Metatext are in a [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/metatext) project.
Translation contributions will be welcome again after some more
project infrastructure is in place for Feditext.

## Contributing Code

See the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building

To build Feditext:

- Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/feditext/feditext.git`)
- Run `git update-index --skip-worktree Identity.xcconfig` to ignore changes to the ID file so you don't commit them
- Change the development team ID and bundle ID base in [`Identity.xcconfig`](Identity.xcconfig) to your own

All dependencies are managed using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager) and will automatically be installed by Xcode.

### Push Notifications

Push notifications will not work in development builds of Feditext unless you host your own instance of [feditext-apns](https://github.com/feditext/feditext-apns) and change the `pushSubscriptionEndpointURL` constants in [`IdentityService.swift`](ServiceLayer/Sources/ServiceLayer/Services/IdentityService.swift) to its URL.

There is an issue to track this: feditext/feditext#15.

## Architecture

- Feditext uses the [Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel).
- View models are clients of a service layer that abstracts network and local database logic.
- Different levels of the architecture are in different local Swift Packages. `import DB` and `import MastodonAPI` should generally only be done within the `ServiceLayer` package, and `import ServiceLayer` only within the `ViewModels` package.
