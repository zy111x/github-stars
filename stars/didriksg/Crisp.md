# Crisp

Crisp is an open-source, lightweight, native macOS menu bar app for managing your displays, and a free alternative to BetterDisplay and Lunar. Scaling, brightness, color, arrangement, and presets, without leaving the menu bar; built to feel like an expanded version of the Mac's built-in display menu: the controls you already use, plus the ones it's missing.

The headline feature is proper display scaling for external monitors. macOS only offers sharp, scaled resolutions on its own Retina displays, so most monitors below 4K (like 1080p and 1440p) look either blurry when you scale them up or too small at native resolution. Crisp adds the HiDPI (Retina-style) scaled resolutions macOS leaves out, so everything looks sharp and scaled right.

No Pro tier, no license key. Crisp keeps every feature free, including a few that BetterDisplay and Lunar charge for: flexible HiDPI scaling, disconnecting displays, color adjustments, and auto-brightness that follows your built-in screen.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask didriksg/tap/crisp
```

Or grab `Crisp.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/didriksg/Crisp/releases) and drag Crisp to Applications.

## Features

- **Sharp, Retina-quality scaling on any display**: HiDPI scaled resolutions that make external monitors crisp instead of blurry or undersized, set up automatically for 1440p and larger displays, and always at the panel's full refresh rate (no more 1080p stuck at 50Hz on a 144Hz monitor)
- **Smooth scaling**: fine-tune how large everything looks in small steps, well beyond the handful of scaled sizes macOS offers; the flexible scaling people install BetterDisplay for
- **Brightness everywhere**: controls the real backlight of external monitors (DDC), dims via software on monitors that don't support that, and can keep dimming below the hardware minimum. Smooth fades, and brightness keys that follow the pointer, target all displays, or a chosen subset
- **Presets**: save named display configurations (resolution, brightness, arrangement) with custom icons and colors, apply with one click, update in place
- **Display arrangement**: drag-to-arrange canvas, main display switching
- **Disconnect displays**: turn physical displays off and back on from the menu, remembered across sleep/wake (Apple Silicon)
- **System toggles**: Dark Mode, Night Shift, and True Tone, one click from the menu bar
- **Color**: ICC profile switching, XDR reference presets, and image adjustment (gamma, contrast, gain, invert colors)
- **Virtual displays**: create HiDPI virtual screens
- **Extras**: combined brightness slider, auto brightness following the built-in display, a toggle for macOS's own ambient auto-brightness, keep awake, notch hiding, launch at login

## Support

Crisp is and will stay completely free. Its main running cost is the $99/year Apple Developer Program, Apple's fee for signing and notarizing the app so it installs cleanly. If you've found Crisp useful, or it saved you a BetterDisplay or Lunar license, and you'd like to chip in toward keeping Crisp signed and notarized, there's:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/didriksg)
- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/didriksg)
- [爱发电 (Afdian)](https://ifdian.net/a/didriksg)

Completely optional, but you'll have my heartfelt thanks.

### Sponsors

Thank you to the people chipping in toward keeping Crisp signed and notarized:

- **Barry** ([@BarryBarrywu](https://github.com/BarryBarrywu))

## Requirements

- macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later; on macOS 26 the panel uses the native Liquid Glass backdrop

## Permissions

- **Administrator password** (one time, per monitor): needed only when you turn on smooth scaling, which installs a display override file into `/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides` that macOS protects. Regular HiDPI scaling and everything else are password-free.
- **Accessibility** (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility): needed only if you turn on Brightness Keys, which routes the keyboard brightness keys to other displays (follow the pointer, all connected, or a chosen subset). Without it, everything else still works; the keys just control the built-in display as usual.

## Building

```sh
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate   # generates Crisp.xcodeproj from project.yml
open Crisp.xcodeproj
```

For a distributable DMG (Command Line Tools only, no full Xcode) and the fast edit-compile-run dev loop, see [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Found a bug, want a feature, or have a display Crisp doesn't handle well? [Open an issue](https://github.com/didriksg/Crisp/issues). PRs are just as welcome, whether it's a fix, a feature, or a new translation.

## Origin

Crisp began as a fork of [FreeDisplay](https://github.com/huberdf/FreeDisplay) and has since been substantially rewritten: a custom panel architecture, native controls throughout, a reworked brightness pipeline, and a full redesign. Thanks to FreeDisplay for the foundation and the spirit: free display management for everyone.
