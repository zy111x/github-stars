## Acknowledgements

Sätteri builds on the work and knowledge of several open-source projects:

- [unifiedjs] -- the ecosystem of tools for processing content with syntax trees, including [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype)
- [pulldown-cmark] -- CommonMark pull parser
- [mdxjs-rs] -- MDX compiler by Titus Wormer, forked to use pulldown-cmark and OXC

Special thanks to the following projects for paving the way for high-performance Rust <-> JavaScript interop:

- [oxc] -- Rust JavaScript parser and compiler by the OXC team, used for MDX compilation
- [Lightning CSS] -- Rust CSS parser with a optimized JavaScript Visitor API
