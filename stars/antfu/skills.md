# Anthony Fu's Skills

A curated collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) reflecting [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)'s preferences, experience, and best practices, along with usage documentation for the tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a proof-of-concept project for generating agent skills from source documentation and keeping them in sync.
> I haven't fully tested how well the skills perform in practice, so feedback and contributions are greatly welcome.

## Installation

```bash
pnpx skills add antfu/skills --skill='*'
```

or to install all of them globally:

```bash
pnpx skills add antfu/skills --skill='*' -g
```

## FAQ

### What Makes This Collection Different?

This collection is opinionated, but the key difference is that it uses git submodules to directly reference source documentation. This provides more reliable context and allows the skills to stay up-to-date with upstream changes over time. If you primarily work with Vue/Vite/Nuxt, this aims to be a comprehensive one-stop collection.

The project is also designed to be flexible - you can use it as a template to generate your own skills collection.

### Skills vs llms.txt vs AGENTS.md

To me, the value of skills lies in being **shareable** and **on-demand**.

Being shareable makes prompts easier to manage and reuse across projects. Being on-demand means skills can be pulled in as needed, scaling far beyond what any agent's context window could fit at once.

You might hear people say "AGENTS.md outperforms skills". I think that's true — AGENTS.md loads everything upfront, so agents always respect it, whereas skills can have false negatives where agents don't pull them in when you'd expect. That said, I see this more as a gap in tooling and integration that will improve over time. Skills are really just a standardized format for agents to consume—plain markdown files at the end of the day. Think of them as a knowledge base for agents. If you want certain skills to always apply, you can reference them directly in your AGENTS.md.
