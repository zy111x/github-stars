Install
-------

The simplest, cross-platform way to get started is to download Caddy from GitHub Releases and place the executable file in your PATH.

See our online documentation for other install instructions.

Build from source
-----------------

Requirements:

-   Go 1.22.3 or newer

### For development

_**Note:** These steps will not embed proper version information. For that, please follow the instructions in the next section._

$ git clone "https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy.git"
$ cd caddy/cmd/caddy/
$ go build

When you run Caddy, it may try to bind to low ports unless otherwise specified in your config. If your OS requires elevated privileges for this, you will need to give your new binary permission to do so. On Linux, this can be done easily with: `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./caddy`

If you prefer to use `go run` which only creates temporary binaries, you can still do this with the included `setcap.sh` like so:

$ go run -exec ./setcap.sh main.go

If you don't want to type your password for `setcap`, use `sudo visudo` to edit your sudoers file and allow your user account to run that command without a password, for example:

```
username ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/setcap
```

replacing `username` with your actual username. Please be careful and only do this if you know what you are doing! We are only qualified to document how to use Caddy, not Go tooling or your computer, and we are providing these instructions for convenience only; please learn how to use your own computer at your own risk and make any needful adjustments.

### With version information and/or plugins

Using our builder tool, `xcaddy`...

```
$ xcaddy build
```

...the following steps are automated:

1.  Create a new folder: `mkdir caddy`
2.  Change into it: `cd caddy`
3.  Copy Caddy's main.go into the empty folder. Add imports for any custom plugins you want to add.
4.  Initialize a Go module: `go mod init caddy`
5.  (Optional) Pin Caddy version: `go get github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2@version` replacing `version` with a git tag, commit, or branch name.
6.  (Optional) Add plugins by adding their import: `_ "import/path/here"`
7.  Compile: `go build -tags=nobadger,nomysql,nopgx`

Quick start
-----------

The Caddy website has documentation that includes tutorials, quick-start guides, reference, and more.

**We recommend that all users -- regardless of experience level -- do our Getting Started guide to become familiar with using Caddy.**

If you've only got a minute, the website has several quick-start tutorials to choose from! However, after finishing a quick-start tutorial, please read more documentation to understand how the software works. 🙂

Overview
--------

Caddy is most often used as an HTTPS server, but it is suitable for any long-running Go program. First and foremost, it is a platform to run Go applications. Caddy "apps" are just Go programs that are implemented as Caddy modules. Two apps -- `tls` and `http` -- ship standard with Caddy.

Caddy apps instantly benefit from automated documentation, graceful on-line config changes via API, and unification with other Caddy apps.

Although JSON is Caddy's native config language, Caddy can accept input from config adapters which can essentially convert any config format of your choice into JSON: Caddyfile, JSON 5, YAML, TOML, NGINX config, and more.

The primary way to configure Caddy is through its API, but if you prefer config files, the command-line interface supports those too.

Caddy exposes an unprecedented level of control compared to any web server in existence. In Caddy, you are usually setting the actual values of the initialized types in memory that power everything from your HTTP handlers and TLS handshakes to your storage medium. Caddy is also ridiculously extensible, with a powerful plugin system that makes vast improvements over other web servers.

To wield the power of this design, you need to know how the config document is structured. Please see our documentation site for details about Caddy's config structure.

Nearly all of Caddy's configuration is contained in a single config document, rather than being scattered across CLI flags and env variables and a configuration file as with other web servers. This makes managing your server config more straightforward and reduces hidden variables/factors.

About
-----

Matthew Holt began developing Caddy in 2014 while studying computer science at Brigham Young University. (The name "Caddy" was chosen because this software helps with the tedious, mundane tasks of serving the Web, and is also a single place for multiple things to be organized together.) It soon became the first web server to use HTTPS automatically and by default, and now has hundreds of contributors and has served trillions of HTTPS requests.

**The name "Caddy" is trademarked.** The name of the software is "Caddy", not "Caddy Server" or "CaddyServer". Please call it "Caddy" or, if you wish to clarify, "the Caddy web server". Caddy is a registered trademark of Stack Holdings GmbH.
