Tuvix is a modern RSS aggregator that helps you follow all your favorite blogs, podcasts, and news sources in one place. It's not a social network, it's not an algorithmic feed, it's just old-fashioned RSS.

## 👨‍💻 Development

### Git Workflow

Tuvix uses a **trunk-based development** workflow:

- **`main`** - Protected branch, all development happens here
- **Feature branches** - Created from `main`, merged back via PR

**Development Process:**

1. Create feature branches from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Open PRs targeting `main` for review and CI checks
3. After approval, changes merge to `main` and auto-deploy to staging
4. Production deployments happen via manual promotion or release tags

### Configuration

**Required:** `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (generate: `openssl rand -base64 32`)

**Optional:** `DATABASE_PATH`, `PORT`, `CORS_ORIGIN`

See `env.example` for all options.
