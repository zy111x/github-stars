### **Hoppscotch**

**Open Source API Development Ecosystem**

Built with ❤︎ by contributors

  

_We highly recommend you take a look at the **Hoppscotch Documentation** to learn more about the app._

#### **Support**

### **Features**

❤️ **Lightweight:** Crafted with minimalistic UI design.

⚡️ **Fast:** Send requests and get responses in real time.

🗄️ **HTTP Methods:** Request methods define the type of action you are requesting to be performed.

-   `GET` - Requests retrieve resource information
-   `POST` - The server creates a new entry in a database
-   `PUT` - Updates an existing resource
-   `PATCH` - Very similar to `PUT` but makes a partial update on a resource
-   `DELETE` - Deletes resource or related component
-   `HEAD` - Retrieve response headers identical to those of a GET request, but without the response body.
-   `CONNECT` - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
-   `OPTIONS` - Describe the communication options for the target resource
-   `TRACE` - Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
-   `<custom>` - Some APIs use custom request methods such as `LIST`. Type in your custom methods.

🌈 **Theming:** Customizable combinations for background, foreground, and accent colors — customize now.

-   Choose a theme: System preference, Light, Dark, and Black
-   Choose accent colors: Green, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Purple, Yellow, Orange, Red, and Pink

_Collections are synced with your cloud/local session storage._

📜 **Pre-Request Scripts:** Snippets of code associated with a request that is executed before the request is sent.

-   Set environment variables
-   Include timestamp in the request headers
-   Send a random alphanumeric string in the URL parameters
