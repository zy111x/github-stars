üîß Troubleshooting
------------------

### Common Issues

**Node not appearing in ComfyUI**

-   Ensure ComfyUI is restarted after installation
-   Check that files are in the correct `custom_nodes` directory
-   Verify no Python errors in the console

**Random options not working**

-   Connect a seed input to enable randomization
-   Ensure "random üé≤" is selected in dropdown menus
-   Check that the seed is properly connected

**Preset system not working**

-   Verify write permissions in the ComfyUI directory
-   Check that the `presets` folder is created automatically
-   Ensure preset names don't contain invalid characters

**Nationality mixing not working**

-   Install ComfyUI Prompt Control for full syntax support
-   Use the format: `[nationality_1:nationality_2:mix_value]`
-   This feature is experimental and may not work with all models

**Output prompts too complex**

-   Use the Prompt Styler node to simplify for modern models
-   Reduce weight values for subtle effects
-   Set unused parameters to "-" to exclude them

### Performance Issues

-   **Large workflows**: Consider using fewer nodes simultaneously
-   **Memory usage**: High detail settings may increase VRAM requirements
-   **Generation speed**: Complex prompts may slow down inference
