# Tailark

Tailark is a design and component toolkit built for founders and teams who want to ship modern marketing websites faster. It provides a large collection of responsive, production-ready blocks built with shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and TypeScript. The components are fully open and editable, so they fit naturally into your codebase without introducing a new design system or locking you into fixed styling patterns.

## Dusk Kit

Dusk is a set of blocks designed to be stylish and elegant, ideal for dark mode websites while also working well in light themes.
