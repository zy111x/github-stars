## Introduction

Plunk is an open-source email platform built on top of AWS SES. It allows you to easily send emails from your
applications.
It can be considered as a self-hosted alternative to services
like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), [Resend](https://resend.com) or [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/).

## Features

- **Transactional Emails**: Send emails straight from your API with template support and variable substitution
- **Campaigns**: Send newsletters and product updates to large audiences with segmentation
- **Workflows**: Create advanced automations with triggers, delays, and conditional logic
- **Contact Management**: Organize contacts with custom fields and dynamic segmentation
- **Analytics**: Track opens, clicks, bounces, and engagement metrics in real-time
- **Custom Domains**: Verify and send from your own domains with DKIM/SPF support

## Sponsors

Plunk is made possible by the support of our sponsors. If you self-host Plunk, consider supporting
