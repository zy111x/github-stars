# **vlt** serverless registry (`vsr`)

`vsr` aims to be a minimal "npm-compatible" registry which replicates the core features found in `registry.npmjs.org` as well as adding net-new capabilities.

### Quick Starts

#### Local

You can quickly get started by installing/executing `vsr` with the following command:

```bash
npx -y vltpkg/vsr
```

#### Production

You can deploy `vsr` to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) in under 5 minutes, for free, with a single click (coming soon).

<!-- [![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/vltpkg/vsr) -->

Alternatively, you can deploy to production using [`wrangler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrangler) after following the **Development** quick start steps.

#### Development

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vltpkg/vsr.git

# navigate to the repository directory
cd ./vsr

# install the project's dependencies
npm install

# run tbe development script
npm run dev
```

### Requirements

#### Production

- [Cloudflare (free account at minimum)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/plans/developer-platform/)
  - Workers (free: 100k requests /day)
  - D1 Database (free: 100k writes, 5M reads /day & 5GB Storage /mo)
  - R2 Bucket (free: 1M writes, 10M reads & 10GB /mo)

> Note: all usage numbers & pricing documented is as of **October 24th, 2024**. Plans & metering is subject to change at Cloudflare's discretion.

#### Development

- `git`
- `node`
- `npm`

### Granular Access Tokens

All tokens are considered "granular access tokens" (GATs). Token entries in the database consist of 3 parts:

- `token` the unique token value
- `uuid` associative value representing a single user/scope
- `scope` value representing the granular access/privileges

#### `scope` as a JSON `Object`

A `scope` contains an array of privileges that define both the type(s) of & access value(s) for a token.

> [!NOTE]
> Tokens can be associated with multiple "types" of access

- `type(s)`:
  - `pkg:read` read associated packages
  - `pkg:read+write` write associated packages (requires read access)
  - `user:read` read associated user
  - `user:read+write` write associated user (requires read access)
- `value(s)`:
  - `*` an ANY selector for `user:` or `pkg:` access types
  - `~<user>` user selector for the `user:` access type
  - `@<scope>/<pkg>` package specific selector for the `pkg:` access type
  - `@<scope>/*` glob scope selector for `pkg:` access types

> [!NOTE]
> - user/org/team management via `@<scope>` is not supported at the moment

### API

We have rich, interactive API docs out-of-the-box with the help of our friends [Scalar](https://scalar.com/). The docs can be found at the registry root when running `vsr` locally (ex. run `npx -y vltpkg/vsr` &/or check out this repo & run `npm run dev`)

### `npm` Client Compatibility

The following commands should work out-of-the-box with `npm` & any other `npm` "compatible" clients although their specific commands & arguments may vary (ex. `vlt`, `yarn`, `pnpm` & `bun`)

#### Configuration

To use `vsr` as your registry you must either pass a registry config through a client-specific flag (ex. `--registry=...` for `npm`) or define client-specific configuration which stores the reference to your registry (ex. `.npmrc` for `npm`). Access to the registry & packages is private by default although an `"admin"` user is created during setup locally (for development purposes) with a default auth token of `"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"`.

```ini
; .npmrc
registry=http://localhost:1337
//localhost:1337/:_authToken=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
