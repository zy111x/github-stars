## Overview

TalkCody is an **AI Coding Agent** that actually works the way you do—**in parallel, with control, and privately**.

Unlike cloud-only AI tools that lock you into a single model or upload your code to remote servers, TalkCody gives you:
- **True Freedom** - Use any AI model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models) without vendor lock-in
- **Maximum Speed** - Unique four-level parallelism runs multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Your Privacy** - Everything runs locally, your code never leaves your machine
- **Your Money** - 9 ways to use completely free, or leverage your existing ChatGPT Plus/GitHub Copilot

**Built by developers, for developers who value speed, cost, control, and privacy.**
