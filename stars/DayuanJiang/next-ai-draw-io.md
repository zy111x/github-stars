Next AI Draw.io
===============

**AI-Powered Diagram Creation Tool - Chat, Draw, Visualize**

English | 中文 | 日本語

A Next.js web application that integrates AI capabilities with draw.io diagrams. Create, modify, and enhance diagrams through natural language commands and AI-assisted visualization.

> Note: Thanks to ByteDance Doubao sponsorship, the demo site now uses the powerful glm-4.7 model!

Examples
--------

Here are some example prompts and their generated diagrams:

**Animated transformer connectors**  

**Prompt:** Give me a \*\*animated connector\*\* diagram of transformer's architecture.

**RAG Technique Diagram**  

**Prompt:** Generate a RAG architecture diagram for \*\*chat application\*\*. Use connected diagram for data ingestion

**Authentication using React and AWS**  

**Prompt:** Generate authentication process using React with \*\*AWS\*\*. Use Serverless architecture.

**Open Innovation**  

**Prompt:** Create visualization of Henry Chesbrough's Open Innovation model.

**Cat sketch**  

**Prompt:** Draw a cute cat for me.

Features
--------

-   **LLM-Powered Diagram Creation**: Leverage Large Language Models to create and manipulate draw.io diagrams directly through natural language commands
-   **Image-Based Diagram Replication**: Upload existing diagrams or images and have the AI replicate and enhance them automatically
-   **PDF & Text File Upload**: Upload PDF documents and text files to extract content and generate diagrams from existing documents
-   **AI Reasoning Display**: View the AI's thinking process for supported models (OpenAI o1/o3, Gemini, Claude, etc.)
-   **Diagram History**: Comprehensive version control that tracks all changes, allowing you to view and restore previous versions of your diagrams before the AI editing.
-   **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with AI to refine your diagrams in real-time
-   **Cloud Architecture Diagram Support**: Specialized support for generating cloud architecture diagrams (AWS, GCP, Azure)
-   **Animated Connectors**: Create dynamic and animated connectors between diagram elements for better visualization

MCP Server
----------

Use Next AI Draw.io with AI agents like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "drawio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": \["@next-ai-drawio/mcp-server@latest"\]
    }
  }
}

### Claude Code CLI

claude mcp add drawio -- npx @next-ai-drawio/mcp-server@latest

Then ask Claude to create diagrams:

> "Create a flowchart showing user authentication with login, MFA, and session management"

The diagram appears in your browser in real-time!

See the MCP Server README for VS Code, Cursor, and other client configurations.

Getting Started
---------------

### Try it Online

No installation needed! Try the app directly on our demo site:

> **Bring Your Own API Key**: You can use your own API key to bypass usage limits on the demo site. Click the Settings icon in the chat panel to configure your provider and API key. Your key is stored locally in your browser and is never stored on the server.

### Desktop Application

Download the native desktop app for your platform from the Releases page:

Supported platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux.

### Run with Docker

Go to Docker Guide

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/DayuanJiang/next-ai-draw-io
cd next-ai-draw-io
npm install
cp env.example .env.local

See the Provider Configuration Guide for detailed setup instructions for each provider.

1.  Run the development server:

npm run dev

1.  Open http://localhost:6002 in your browser to see the application.

Deployment
----------

### Deploy to EdgeOne Pages

You can deploy with one click using Tencent EdgeOne Pages.

Deploy by this button:

Check out the Tencent EdgeOne Pages documentation for more details.

Additionally, deploying through Tencent EdgeOne Pages will also grant you a daily free quota for DeepSeek models.

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is using Vercel, the creators of Next.js. Be sure to **set the environment variables** in the Vercel dashboard as you did in your local `.env.local` file.

See the Next.js deployment documentation for more details.

### Deploy on Cloudflare Workers

Go to Cloudflare Deploy Guide

Multi-Provider Support
----------------------

-   ByteDance Doubao
-   AWS Bedrock (default)
-   OpenAI
-   Anthropic
-   Google AI
-   Google Vertex AI
-   Azure OpenAI
-   Ollama
-   OpenRouter
-   DeepSeek
-   SiliconFlow
-   ModelScope
-   SGLang
-   Vercel AI Gateway

All providers except AWS Bedrock and OpenRouter support custom endpoints.

📖 **Detailed Provider Configuration Guide** - See setup instructions for each provider.

### Server-Side Multi-Model Configuration

Administrators can configure multiple server-side models that are available to all users without requiring personal API keys. Configure via `AI_MODELS_CONFIG` environment variable (JSON string) or `ai-models.json` file.

**Model Requirements**: This task requires strong model capabilities for generating long-form text with strict formatting constraints (draw.io XML). Recommended models include Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and DeepSeek V3.2/R1.

Note that the `claude` series has been trained on draw.io diagrams with cloud architecture logos like AWS, Azure, GCP. So if you want to create cloud architecture diagrams, this is the best choice.

How It Works
------------

The application uses the following technologies:

-   **Next.js**: For the frontend framework and routing
-   **Vercel AI SDK** (`ai` + `@ai-sdk/*`): For streaming AI responses and multi-provider support
-   **react-drawio**: For diagram representation and manipulation

Diagrams are represented as XML that can be rendered in draw.io. The AI processes your commands and generates or modifies this XML accordingly.
