## Why Craft Agents was built
Craft Agents is a tool we built so that we (at craft.do) can work effectively with agents. It enables intuitive multitasking, no-fluff connection to any API or Service, sharing sessions, and a more document (vs code) centric workflow - in a beautiful and fluid UI.

It uses the Claude Agent SDK and the Pi SDK side by side—building on what we found great and improving areas where we've desired improvements.

It's built with Agent Native software principles in mind, and is highly customisable out of the box. One of the first of its kind.

Craft Agents is open source under the Apache 2.0 license - so you are free to remix, change anything. And that's actually possible. We ourselves are building Craft Agents with Craft Agents only - no code editors - so really, any customisation is just a prompt away.

We built Craft Agents because we wanted a better, more opinionated (and preferably non-CLI way) of working with the most powerful agents in the world. We'll continue to improve it, based on our experiences and intuition.

## Things that are hard to believe "just work"

**How do I connect to Linear, Gmail, Slack...?**
Tell the agent "add Linear as a source." It finds public APIs and MCP servers, reads their docs, sets up credentials, and configures everything. No config files, no setup wizards.

[Check out how I just connected to Slack →](https://agents.craft.do/s/DRNQEiy8w2e1v5LPgKl8b)

**I already have my MCP config JSON.**
Paste it. The agent handles the rest.

**What about local MCPs?**
Fully supported. Stdio-based MCP servers run as local subprocesses on your machine. Point it at an npx command, a Python script, or any local binary. It just works.

**Can it handle custom APIs?**
Yes. Paste an OpenAPI spec, some endpoint URLs, screenshots of docs, whatever you have. It figures it out and guides you through the rest.

**APIs too? Not just MCPs?**
Craft Agents connects to anything. We have it hooked up to a direct Postgres DB behind a jumpbox. Skills + Sources = magic.

**How do I import my Claude Code skills and MCPs?**
Tell the agent you want to import your skills from Claude Code. It handles the migration.

[Here I imported all my skills in one go →](https://agents.craft.do/s/gWCFqwhObFWaNJIEJmd6j)

**How do I create a new skill?**
Describe what the skill should do, give it context. The agent takes care of the rest.

**Do I need to restart after changes?**
No. Everything is instant. Mention new skills or sources with `@`, even mid-conversation.

**So I can just ask it anything?**
Yes. That's the core idea behind agent-native software. You describe what you want, and it figures out how. That's a good use of tokens.

## Development

```bash
# Hot reload development
bun run electron:dev

# Build and run
bun run electron:start

# Type checking
bun run typecheck:all

# Debug logging (writes to ~/Library/Logs/Craft Agents/)
# Logs are automatically enabled in development
```

### Environment Variables

OAuth integrations (Slack, Microsoft) require credentials baked into the build. Create a `.env` file:

```bash
MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SLACK_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-slack-client-id
SLACK_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-slack-client-secret
```

**Note:** Google OAuth credentials are NOT baked into the build. Users provide their own credentials via source configuration. See the [Google OAuth Setup](#google-oauth-setup-gmail-calendar-drive) section below.

### Google OAuth Setup (Gmail, Calendar, Drive)

Google integrations require you to create your own OAuth credentials. This is a one-time setup.

#### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
3. Note your Project ID

#### 2. Enable Required APIs

Go to **APIs & Services → Library** and enable the APIs you need:
- **Gmail API** - for email integration
- **Google Calendar API** - for calendar integration
- **Google Drive API** - for file storage integration

#### 3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**
2. Select **External** user type (unless you have Google Workspace)
3. Fill in required fields:
   - App name: e.g., "My Craft Agent"
   - User support email: your email
   - Developer contact: your email
4. Add scopes (optional - can leave default)
5. Add yourself as a test user (required for External apps in testing mode)
6. Complete the wizard

#### 4. Create OAuth Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID**
3. Application type: **Desktop app**
4. Name: e.g., "Craft Agent Desktop"
5. Click **Create**
6. Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

#### 5. Configure in Craft Agent

When setting up a Google source (Gmail, Calendar, Drive), add these fields to your source's `config.json`:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "googleService": "gmail",
    "googleOAuthClientId": "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "googleOAuthClientSecret": "your-client-secret"
  }
}
```

Or simply tell the agent you want to connect Gmail/Calendar/Drive - it will guide you through entering your credentials.

#### Security Notes

- Your OAuth credentials are stored encrypted alongside other source credentials
- Never commit credentials to version control
- For production use, consider getting your OAuth consent screen verified by Google

## Supported LLM Providers

Craft Agents supports multiple ways to connect to LLM providers:

### Direct Connections

| Provider | Auth | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Anthropic** | API key or Claude Max/Pro OAuth | Direct Claude connection via the Claude Agent SDK |
| **Google AI Studio** | API key | Gemini models with native Google Search grounding built in |
| **ChatGPT Plus / Pro** | Codex OAuth | Sign in with your ChatGPT subscription — uses OpenAI's Codex models |
| **GitHub Copilot** | OAuth (device code) | One-click authentication with your Copilot subscription |

### Third-Party & Self-Hosted Providers

Additional providers are supported through the **Claude / Anthropic API Key** connection by choosing a custom endpoint:

| Provider | Endpoint | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | `https://openrouter.ai/api` | Access Claude, GPT, Llama, Gemini, and hundreds of other models through a single API key. Use `provider/model-name` format (e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`). |
| **Vercel AI Gateway** | `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh` | Route requests through Vercel's AI Gateway with built-in observability and caching. |
| **Ollama** | `http://localhost:11434` | Run open-source models locally. No API key required. |
| **Custom** | Any URL | Any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible endpoint. |

### Architecture

Craft Agents uses two agent backends:

- **Claude** — powered by the [Claude Agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk), which natively supports custom base URLs and provider routing. Anthropic API key, Claude Max/Pro OAuth, and all third-party endpoints use this backend.
- **Pi** — powered by the Pi SDK, which handles Google AI Studio, ChatGPT Plus (Codex OAuth), GitHub Copilot OAuth, and OpenAI API key connections. Pi connections route through their own provider infrastructure.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `~/.craft-agent/`:

```
~/.craft-agent/
├── config.json              # Main config (workspaces, LLM connections)
├── credentials.enc          # Encrypted credentials (AES-256-GCM)
├── preferences.json         # User preferences
├── theme.json               # App-level theme
└── workspaces/
    └── {id}/
        ├── config.json      # Workspace settings
        ├── theme.json       # Workspace theme override
        ├── automations.json  # Event-driven automations
        ├── sessions/        # Session data (JSONL)
        ├── sources/         # Connected sources
        ├── skills/          # Custom skills
        └── statuses/        # Status configuration
```

### Automations

Automations let you automate workflows by triggering actions when events happen — labels change, sessions start, tools run, or on a cron schedule.

**Just ask the agent:**
- "Set up a daily standup briefing every weekday at 9am"
- "Notify me when a session is labelled urgent"
- "Track permission mode changes and summarise them"
- "Every Friday at 5pm, summarise this week's completed tasks"

Or configure manually in `~/.craft-agent/workspaces/{id}/automations.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "automations": {
    "SchedulerTick": [
      {
        "cron": "0 9 * * 1-5",
        "timezone": "America/New_York",
        "labels": ["Scheduled"],
        "actions": [
          { "type": "prompt", "prompt": "Check @github for new issues assigned to me" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "LabelAdd": [
      {
        "matcher": "^urgent$",
        "actions": [
          { "type": "prompt", "prompt": "An urgent label was added. Triage the session and summarise what needs attention." }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Prompt actions** create a new agent session with a prompt. They support `@mentions` for sources and skills, and environment variables like `$CRAFT_LABEL` and `$CRAFT_SESSION_ID` are expanded automatically.

**Supported events:** `LabelAdd`, `LabelRemove`, `PermissionModeChange`, `FlagChange`, `SessionStatusChange`, `SchedulerTick`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, and more.

See the [Automations documentation](https://agents.craft.do/docs/automations/overview) for the full reference.

## Advanced Features

### Large Response Handling

Tool responses exceeding ~60KB are automatically summarized using Claude Haiku with intent-aware context. The `_intent` field is injected into MCP tool schemas to preserve summarization focus.

### Deep Linking

External apps can navigate using `craftagents://` URLs:

```
craftagents://allSessions                      # All sessions view
craftagents://allSessions/session/session123   # Specific session
craftagents://settings                         # Settings
craftagents://sources/source/github            # Source info
craftagents://action/new-chat                  # Create new session
```

## Security

### Local MCP Server Isolation

When spawning local MCP servers (stdio transport), sensitive environment variables are filtered out to prevent credential leakage to subprocesses. Blocked variables include:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (app auth)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NPM_TOKEN`

To explicitly pass an env var to a specific MCP server, use the `env` field in the source config.
