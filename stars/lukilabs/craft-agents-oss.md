## Why Craft Agents was built
Craft Agents is a tool we built so that we (at craft.do) can work effectively with agents. It enables intuitive multitasking, no-fluff connection to any API or Service, sharing sessions, and a more document (vs code) centric workflow - in a beautiful and fluid UI.

It leans on Claude Code through the Claude Agent SDK - follows what we found great, and improves areas where we've desired improvements.

It's built with Agent Native software principles in mind, and is highly customisable out of the box. One of the first of its kind.

Craft Agents is open source under the Apache 2.0 license - so you are free to remix, change anything. And that's actually possible. We ourselves are building Craft Agents with Craft Agents only - no code editors - so really, any customisation is just a prompt away.

We built Craft Agents because we wanted a better, more opinionated (and preferably non-CLI way) of working with the most powerful agents in the world. We'll continue to improve it, based on our experiences and intuition.

## Things that are hard to believe "just work"

**How do I connect to Linear, Gmail, Slack...?**
Tell the agent "add Linear as a source." It finds public APIs and MCP servers, reads their docs, sets up credentials, and configures everything. No config files, no setup wizards.

[Check out how I just connected to Slack →](https://agents.craft.do/s/DRNQEiy8w2e1v5LPgKl8b)

**I already have my MCP config JSON.**
Paste it. The agent handles the rest.

**What about local MCPs?**
Fully supported. Stdio-based MCP servers run as local subprocesses on your machine. Point it at an npx command, a Python script, or any local binary. It just works.

**Can it handle custom APIs?**
Yes. Paste an OpenAPI spec, some endpoint URLs, screenshots of docs, whatever you have. It figures it out and guides you through the rest.

**APIs too? Not just MCPs?**
Craft Agents connects to anything. We have it hooked up to a direct Postgres DB behind a jumpbox. Skills + Sources = magic.

**How do I import my Claude Code skills and MCPs?**
Tell the agent you want to import your skills from Claude Code. It handles the migration.

[Here I imported all my skills in one go →](https://agents.craft.do/s/gWCFqwhObFWaNJIEJmd6j)

**How do I create a new skill?**
Describe what the skill should do, give it context. The agent takes care of the rest.

**Do I need to restart after changes?**
No. Everything is instant. Mention new skills or sources with `@`, even mid-conversation.

**So I can just ask it anything?**
Yes. That's the core idea behind agent-native software. You describe what you want, and it figures out how. That's a good use of tokens.

## Development

```bash
# Hot reload development
bun run electron:dev

# Build and run
bun run electron:start

# Type checking
bun run typecheck:all

# Debug logging (writes to ~/Library/Logs/Craft Agents/)
# Logs are automatically enabled in development
```

### Environment Variables

OAuth integrations (Google, Slack, Microsoft) require credentials. Create a `.env` file:

```bash
MICROSOFT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
SLACK_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-slack-client-id
SLACK_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-slack-client-secret
```

See [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to create OAuth credentials.

## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `~/.craft-agent/`:

```
~/.craft-agent/
├── config.json              # Main config (workspaces, auth type)
├── credentials.enc          # Encrypted credentials (AES-256-GCM)
├── preferences.json         # User preferences
├── theme.json               # App-level theme
└── workspaces/
    └── {id}/
        ├── config.json      # Workspace settings
        ├── theme.json       # Workspace theme override
        ├── sessions/        # Session data (JSONL)

        ├── skills/          # Custom skills
        └── statuses/        # Status configuration
```

## Advanced Features

### Large Response Handling

Tool responses exceeding ~60KB are automatically summarized using Claude Haiku with intent-aware context. The `_intent` field is injected into MCP tool schemas to preserve summarization focus.

### Deep Linking

External apps can navigate using `craftagents://` URLs:

```
craftagents://allChats                    # All chats view
craftagents://allChats/chat/session123    # Specific chat
craftagents://settings                    # Settings
craftagents://sources/source/github       # Source info
craftagents://action/new-chat             # Create new chat
```

## Security

### Local MCP Server Isolation

When spawning local MCP servers (stdio transport), sensitive environment variables are filtered out to prevent credential leakage to subprocesses. Blocked variables include:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (app auth)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NPM_TOKEN`

To explicitly pass an env var to a specific MCP server, use the `env` field in the source config.

To report security vulnerabilities, please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
