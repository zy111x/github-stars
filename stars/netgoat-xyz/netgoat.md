# NetGoat agent

NetGoat is a self-hosted reverse proxy and traffic-policy agent written in Go. It can run from a local YAML configuration, consume snapshots from the companion control plane, and continue serving the last known-good configuration during an outage.

> [!WARNING]
> NetGoat is active alpha software. Review the sample configuration, use strong bootstrap credentials, and place administrative services behind TLS before exposing a deployment to the internet.

## Feature status

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain and path routing | Available | Exact, wildcard, regex, and longest-prefix path routes; local routes can be overridden by streamed routes. |
| Load balancing and failover | Available | Round-robin pools, bounded concurrent health checks, and safe-method retry/failover. |
| WAF rules | Available | Precompiled expression rules with priorities, `BLOCK`/`ALLOW` actions, and request host/method/path/query/header context. |
| Traffic controls | Available | Global rate limiting, request queueing, bandwidth throttling, honeypot handling, and dynamic challenges. |
| Shared response cache | Available | Bounded LRU/TTL cache for explicitly public responses, with HTTP freshness and revalidation safeguards. |
| Local authentication | Available | Cookie or Basic authentication, per-user zero-trust challenge flags, and explicit secure bootstrap users. |
| TLS termination | Available | Static certificate and key files configured at startup. |
| WebSocket proxying | Available | Upgrade connections are preserved by Go's reverse proxy. |
| Metrics | Available | JSON and Prometheus endpoints for traffic, cache, block, latency, and proxy-error counters. |
| AI request classifiers | Optional | Local GoatAI, Koda-WAF, and Koda-2 workers; model files and Python dependencies are required only when enabled. |
| Control-plane recovery | Available | Polling with timeouts/backoff, atomic snapshot reconciliation, deduplication, and private on-disk recovery snapshots. |
| Operational telemetry | Optional | Explicitly opt-in delivery to the companion telemetry server, with endpoint and ingestion-key configuration. |
| Automatic certificate issuance/renewal | Planned | Streamed per-domain certificates and automatic ACME renewal are not wired into TLS serving yet. |
| JavaScript/TypeScript dynamic rules | Planned | The current rules engine uses compiled expressions, not an embedded JS/TS runtime. |
| Plugin/middleware SDK | Planned | No stable plugin API exists yet. |
| Cloudflare Access, DNS, and tunnel management | Planned | The agent does not validate Cloudflare Access tokens or manage Cloudflare resources. |
| Per-route cache/bandwidth policies | Planned | These controls are currently process-wide; WAF expressions can still scope decisions by host or path. |

The dashboard shown by the wider NetGoat project belongs to the control plane. This agent exposes metrics APIs but does not embed that dashboard.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- Go 1.24 or newer
- a C toolchain for the SQLite driver
- one or more reachable HTTP upstreams

Clone the repository, edit the sample `routes` in `config.yml`, then run:

```sh
go test ./...
go run .
```

The default listener is `:8080`. A minimal local route looks like this:

```yaml
auth:
  enabled: false

routes:
  app.localhost:
    type: domain
    targets:
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:3000
        health_check: http
```

Then send a request with the configured host:

```sh
curl -H 'Host: app.localhost' http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

If the control plane is unavailable, NetGoat uses local routes and then the last valid recovery snapshot. Configure `api.url` as an empty string for a fully offline deployment.

## Authentication bootstrap

Fresh databases do not contain a default password. To enable local authentication, set both bootstrap variables before the first start:

```sh
export NETGOAT_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME=admin
export NETGOAT_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD='replace-with-at-least-12-characters'
```

Then set `auth.enabled: true`. Bootstrap credentials are used only when the user table is empty; existing users are not overwritten. Basic authentication does not create persistent cookie sessions.

## Configuration highlights

- `routes`: local fallback routes keyed by domain, wildcard/regex pattern, or path prefix.
- `api`: control-plane URL, key, poll interval, timeout, and maximum retry interval.
- `health`: probe enablement, interval, timeout, and default path.
- `cache`, `rate_limit`, `request_queue`, `bandwidth`: bounded process-wide traffic controls.
- `metrics`: enables JSON at the configured path and Prometheus at `<path>.prom`.
- `ssl`: static TLS certificate/key and listen port.
- `telemetry`: disabled by default; endpoint, shared ingestion key, and heartbeat interval.
- `anomaly`, `koda_waf`, `koda_2`: optional local inference workers.

Secrets may also be supplied through the environment. `API_STREAM_KEY` overrides the YAML control-plane key, while `TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` and `TELEMETRY_INGEST_KEY` override their telemetry settings. Do not commit `.env`, model files, databases, recovery snapshots, or telemetry identifiers.

## Architecture

```text
client -> NetGoat agent -> healthy upstream pool
              |    |
              |    +-> SQLite state + recovery snapshot
              +------> stream-server (optional control plane)
              +------> telemetry-server (optional, opt-in)
```

The agent's hot request path applies authentication and traffic controls, resolves a route, evaluates precompiled WAF rules, optionally runs enabled local classifiers, and proxies the request. Health checks and control-plane polling run in bounded background workers.

The optional `docker-compose.yml` starts only a loopback-bound development MongoDB for `stream-server`; the Go agent itself does not require it. Export `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` before running Compose so development credentials stay outside the repository.

## Development

Run the full Go verification suite before submitting changes:

```sh
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
```

Python worker syntax can be checked without installing their model dependencies:

```sh
python3 -m py_compile ai/*.py
```
