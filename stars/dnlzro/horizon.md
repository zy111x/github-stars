# Horizon

The current sky at your approximate location, rendered as a CSS gradient. Refreshes every minute.

Created for [HTML Day 2025](https://html.energy/html-day/2025/index.html) as a showcase of CSS gradients and the little-known `meta http-equiv="Refresh"` HTML tag ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv)).
