## Why Refly?

Most AI Agents fail in production because they rely on "Vibe-coded" scripts and fragile, black-box logic. As the ecosystem moves toward agentic frameworks like Claude Code, AutoGen, and MCP, the bottleneck is no longer the LLM—it's the lack of standardized, reliable actions.

Refly bridges the gap between raw APIs and intelligent agents. We allow you to codify messy business logic into structured, version-controlled Agent skills that any agent can invoke with 100% reliability.

**Stop hard-coding tools.** Build modular skills once in Refly's visual IDE and deploy them as MCP servers, standard APIs, or portable SDKs to any agent framework. <a href="https://refly.ai/workspace"><u>Try it Now</u></a>

## Core Capabilities

### 🎯 Construct with Vibe (Copilot-led Builder)

Describe your business logic in natural language, and Refly's Model-Native DSL compiles your intent into a high-performance skill.

- **Intent-Driven Construction**: Describe the work once; Refly turns intent into deterministic, reusable, and composable skills.
- **Efficiency at Scale**: Streamlined DSL optimized for LLMs, ensuring fast execution and significantly lower token costs.
- **3-Minute Deployment**: Transition from a static enterprise SOP to a production-ready agent skill in under 3 minutes.

### ⚡ Execute with Control (Intervenable Runtime)

Break the "black box" of AI execution with a stateful runtime designed for deterministic reliability.

- **Intervenable Runtime**: Pause, audit, and re-steer agent logic mid-run to ensure 100% operational compliance.
- **Deterministic Guarantees**: Enforce strict business rules that minimize hallucinations and handle failure recovery.

### 🚀 Ship to Production (Unified Agent Stack)

Unify MCP integrations, tools, models, and reusable skills into a single execution layer.

- **Universal Delivery**: Export as APIs for Lovable, webhooks for Slack or Lark/Feishu, or native tools for Claude Code and Cursor.
- **Stable Scheduling**: Run workflows reliably on schedule with managed execution.

### 🏛️ Govern as Assets (Skill Registry)

Transform fragile scripts into governed, shared infrastructure across your organization.

- **Central Skill Registry**: Securely manage, version, and share agent capabilities.
- **Team Workspace Collaboration**: Build together with native version control and audit logs.

---

## Why Teams Choose Refly

### For Builders: From Vibe to Production

Most agent tooling today falls into two categories:

- Workflow builders (n8n, Dify): Great for orchestration, but workflows are fragile, trigger-only "black boxes," and hard to reuse.
- Agent frameworks (LangChain): Powerful primitives, but require heavy engineering, manual boilerplate, and high maintenance to keep running.
Refly eliminates the friction of manual configuration, giving you the fastest path from a "vibe" to a usable agent tool. By using our Streamlined DSL, you get the speed of a GUI with the precision of code.

| Dimension | Legacy Automation <br><sub>(n8n, Dify)</sub> | Code-First SDKs <br><sub>(LangChain)</sub> | **Refly Skills** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interaction Depth** | Trigger-only <br><sub>Black box</sub> | Programmatic <br><sub>Code changes</sub> | **Intervenable runtime**<br><sub>Steer logic mid-run</sub> |
| **Construction** | Manual API wiring & JSON | Manual Python/TS boilerplate | **Copilot-led**<br><sub>Describe intent → skills generated</sub> |
| **Recovery** | Fail = restart from scratch | Debug → redeploy → rerun | **Hot-fix**<br><sub>Repair workflows during execution</sub> |
| **Portability** | Hard to reuse across environments | Framework-specific | **Export everywhere**<br><sub>To Claude Code, Cursor, Manus</sub> |
| **Deployment** | Limited function tools | Custom microservices | **Production Ready**<br><sub>Stateful, validated APIs</sub> |
### For Enterprise: Scalable Skills Governance

Workflow tools like n8n are great for basic connectivity, and frameworks like LangChain offer powerful primitives — but neither provides the governed, production-ready capability layer required for enterprise agent infrastructure.

Refly acts as the Agent skills builder, providing the governance and reliability infrastructure required to deploy AI across the entire organization.

| Enterprise Requirement | Legacy Tools <br><sub>(Workflow-first)</sub> | SDKs <br><sub>(Code-first)</sub> | **Refly (Skill OS)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance & Reuse** | Templates are copied and<br><sub>reconfigured per instance</sub> | No native registry<br><sub>for sharing logic</sub> | **Central skill registry**<br><sub>Versioned, shareable capability assets</sub> |
| **Operational Reliability** | Trigger-based<br><sub>limited recovery</sub> | Custom handling required | **Stateful runtime**<br><sub>With validation + failure recovery</sub> |
| **SOP Enforcement** | Workflows drift<br><sub>across copies</sub> | Depends on manual<br><sub>engineering discipline</sub> | **SOP-grade deterministic skills**<br><sub>With controlled execution</sub> |
| **Deployment** | Instance-bound workflows | Code maintained manually<br><sub>per team</sub> | **Local-first, on-prem ready**<br><sub>Open-source infrastructure</sub> |
| **Total Cost (TCO)** | Overhead grows with<br><sub>workflow complexity</sub> | High engineering<br><sub>maintenance costs</sub> | **Minimal DSL**<br><sub>Reduces token spend</sub> |

## Create Your First Workflow

> [!NOTE]
> This section assumes you have completed [self-deployment](https://docs.refly.ai/community-version/self-deploy/) and can access Refly at `http://localhost:5700`

**Step 1: Register and Log In**

1. Open `http://localhost:5700` in your browser
2. Register with your email and password
3. Configure your first model provider:
   - Click the account icon (top right) → Settings
   - Add a provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Add your first chat model
   - Set it as default

> 📖 Detailed setup with screenshots: [Self-Deployment Guide](https://docs.refly.ai/community-version/self-deploy/#start-using-refly)

**Step 2: Create a Workflow**

1. Click **"New Workflow"** on the home page
2. Choose a template or start from scratch:
   - **Blank Canvas**: Build with visual nodes
   - **Vibe Mode**: Describe your workflow in natural language

**Example - Product Research Workflow**:
```text
1. Add "Web Search" node - searches for product information
2. Add "LLM" node - analyzes search results
3. Add "Output" node - formats the report
4. Connect the nodes
5. Click "Save"
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want the fastest path, start with Vibe Mode and iterate from a template.

**Step 3: Test Your Workflow**

1. Click "Run" button
2. Enter test input (e.g., a product URL)
3. View execution results in real-time
4. Check logs if something fails

**Prerequisites**

- A Lark workspace with admin access
- A workflow created in Refly

**Setup Steps**

1. **In Refly**:
   - Open your workflow
   - Click "Settings" → "Triggers"
   - Enable "Webhook Trigger"
   - Copy the Webhook URL

2. **In Lark/Feishu**:
   - Go to [api.feishu.com/apps](https://open.feishu.cn/app)
   - Create a "Custom App"
   - Navigate to "Event Subscriptions"
   - Paste the Refly Webhook URL into "Request URL"
   - Click "Add Event" and select "Receive Message"
   - Go to "Version Management" and publish the app
     

3. **Test**:
   - In Feishu, find your bot in the search bar and send a message (e.g., `analyze report.pdf`)
   - Your workflow executes and returns results via the webhook


> ⚠️ **Note**: Detailed Lark/Feishu integration guide coming soon. For now, see [API Reference](https://github.com/refly-ai/refly/tree/main/docs/en/guide/api) for webhook configuration.


### Use Case 3: Skills for Claude Code

**Goal**: Publish your Refly workflows as Claude Code skills

**Quick Start**

1. **Install Refly CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @powerformer/refly-cli
```

```bash
# Via Refly CLI
refly skill install <skill-id>

#Via npx
npx skills add refly-ai/<skill-name>
```

3. **Publish a Skill**
