Model Introduction
------------------

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific tasks. However, as the scale of these models increases, optimizing resource consumption while maintaining high performance has become a key challenge. To address this challenge, we have explored Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. The currently unveiled Hunyuan-Large (Hunyuan-MoE-A52B) model is the largest open-source Transformer-based MoE model in the industry, featuring a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion active parameters. This is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based MoE model in the industry, featuring a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion active parameters.

By open-sourcing the Hunyuan-Large model and revealing related technical details, we hope to inspire more researchers with innovative ideas and collectively advance the progress and application of AI technology. We welcome you to join our open-source community to explore and optimize future AI models together!

### Introduction to Technical Advantages

#### Model

-   **High-Quality Synthetic Data**: By enhancing training with synthetic data, Hunyuan-Large can learn richer representations, handle long-context inputs, and generalize better to unseen data.
    
-   **KV Cache Compression**: Utilizes Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Cross-Layer Attention (CLA) strategies to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead of KV caches, improving inference throughput.
    
-   **Expert-Specific Learning Rate Scaling**: Sets different learning rates for different experts to ensure each sub-model effectively learns from the data and contributes to overall performance.
    
-   **Long-Context Processing Capability**: The pre-trained model supports text sequences up to 256K, and the Instruct model supports up to 128K, significantly enhancing the ability to handle long-context tasks.
    
-   **Extensive Benchmarking**: Conducts extensive experiments across various languages and tasks to validate the practical effectiveness and safety of Hunyuan-Large.
    

#### Inference Framework

-   This open-source release offers two inference backend options tailored for the Hunyuan-Large model: the popular vLLM-backend and the TensorRT-LLM Backend. Both solutions include optimizations for enhanced performance. For instance, the introduction of a new CLA structure significantly reduces GPU memory usage, achieving a 50% savings in the KV-Cache portion, which ensures efficient handling of long text scenarios. Additionally, by employing FP8 quantization, we achieve a 50% reduction in memory usage compared to traditional FP16/BF16 quantization, while maintaining precision and resulting in a 70% increase in throughput. Meanwhile, by leveraging the efficient operators at the core of TRT-LLM, the performance of the TRT-LLM solution surpasses that of vLLM by over 30%. The TRT-LLM solution is widely used in Tencent's Hunyuan project. In this release, we are initially open-sourcing the vLLM solution, with plans to release the TRT-LLM solution in the near future.

#### Training Framework

-   The Hunyuan-Large open-source model is fully compatible with the Hugging Face format, enabling researchers and developers to perform model fine-tuning using the hf-deepspeed framework. Additionally, we support training acceleration through the use of flash attention. To further assist in the adoption process, we have made the corresponding training scripts and model implementations publicly available to the community through this release, facilitating subsequent model training and fine-tuning operations based on these resources.

Data
----

Hunyuan-Large provides model training-related processes. In this section, you can process the training data format for use in model training.

### Training Data Format and Processing

Training data is processed into a messages format as follows. The default system prompt for training and inference is "You are a helpful assistant." Below are examples of single-turn and multi-turn data:

\# Single-Turn Data Format

messages \= \[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "海水为什么是咸的" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "海水是咸的主要是因为其中含有许多溶解在水中的盐类和矿物质。这些盐类和矿物质来自于地球表面的岩石和土壤中的化学物质，随着时间的推移，它们被带到了海洋中。当海水蒸发时，水分蒸发掉了，但盐类和矿物质仍然留在水中，导致海水变得更加咸味。因此，海水的咸度是由其中的盐类和矿物质的含量决定的。"}
\]

\# Multi-Turn Data Format
messages \= \[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "知道重庆森林这部电影吗？" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "知道呀，是一部由王家卫导演的片子。" },
    {"role": "user", "content": " 而主演里更是有王菲，一上映便受到追捧。" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "所以此片获得了第14届香港电影金像奖最佳影片奖。"}
\]

Quick Start
-----------

You can quickly get started by referring to the content in the Quick Start Guide.

Model Training
--------------

To simplify the Training process, HunyuanLLM provides a pre-built Docker image:

hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large.

### Hardware Requirements

Tested on H20, without enabling `make_moe_param_leaf_module` and using `zero3+offload`, with a `max_seq_length` of 2048, full fine-tuning requires at least 32 GPUs, and LoRA fine-tuning requires at least 8 GPUs.

### Training Performance

With the minimum configuration (8 GPUs for LoRA fine-tuning), `per_device_train_batch_size` is set to 1, and `gradient_accumulation_steps` is set to 1, resulting in approximately 35 seconds per iteration.

### Launch Method

Refer to: HuggingFace Transformers Trainer

#### Single-Machine Training

In the `train` directory, execute:

pip install -r requirements.txt
bash train.sh

#### Multi-Machine Training

To start training on multiple machines, follow the steps below and ensure that all machines are within the same cluster.

##### Configure Passwordless SSH Login Between Machines

The following steps use two machines as an example, with their IPs represented as `${ip1}` and `${ip2}`. These operations are performed within a Docker container.

First, configure passwordless SSH between containers on each machine.

ssh-keygen			# Generate id\_rsa and id\_rsa.pub for passwordless login
ssh-keygen -t rsa -A    # Generate /etc/ssh/ssh\_host\_rsa\_key and ssh\_host\_ecdsa\_key for starting 'SSH listen' later
/usr/sbin/sshd -p 36005 -o ListenAddress=0.0.0.0        # Start SSH listen
echo "Port 36005" \> ~/.ssh/config   # Change SSH connection port to 36005
passwd root    # Set root password to avoid alerts from monitoring platforms

Note: The `36005` here is an example. You can choose any port, but ensure that the port is **open** and **not occupied by other processes**.

Next, within the container on each machine, execute:

cat ~/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub

**Copy the output SSH public key and paste it into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, with one public key per line. This must be done on every machine.** Ultimately, the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on each machine should be identical and contain the public keys of all machines.

It's important to note that during multi-node training, the code executed on each node must be consistent. It is recommended to mount a shared network drive. If mounting a shared drive is not possible, you need to manually copy the dataset, scripts, and code to the same directory on all machines.

##### Start Multi-Machine Training

Once the preparation steps are completed and dependencies are confirmed to be installed (if not, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install), you can add the following configuration at the beginning of `train.sh`:

export HOST\_GPU\_NUM=8
# Current machine IP
export LOCAL\_IP=${ip1}
# Multi-node machine IPs, separated by commas
export NODE\_IP\_LIST="${ip1}:8,${ip2}:8"
# Number of machine nodes
export NODES=2
export NODE\_NUM=$((${NODES} \* ${HOST\_GPU\_NUM}))

Note: Replace `${ip1}` and `${ip2}` with the actual IP addresses!

Then, on the machine with `${ip1}`, execute `bash train.sh` in the `train/` directory. Note that on the first run, you might see the following output:

```
The authenticity of host '[ip]:36005 ([ip]:36005)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is xxxxxx.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:xxxxxx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

At this point, type `yes` to continue.

##### Key Parameters

The key parameters in the script are as follows:

-   `--deepspeed`: This parameter should point to a DeepSpeed configuration file. The `train` folder provides three default DeepSpeed configuration files: `ds_zero2_no_offload.json`, `ds_zero3_no_offload.json`, `ds_zero3_offload.json`. The required GPU memory decreases in this order.
-   `--model_name_or_path`: The path to the HF pre-trained model. Ensure this path contains the `modeling_hunyuan.py` and `configuration_hunyuan.py` files; otherwise, it cannot be loaded.
-   `--tokenizer_name_or_path`: The path to the tokenizer folder. Ensure this path contains the `tokenization_hy.py` file; otherwise, it cannot be loaded.
-   `--train_data_file`: The path to the training file, which should be a JSONL file.
-   `--output_dir`: The output directory where logs, tensorboard files, and model weights will be stored.
-   `--per_device_train_batch_size`: The batch size per GPU.
-   `--gradient_accumulation_steps`: The number of gradient accumulation steps. The global batch size is `per_device_train_batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps * dp_size`.
-   `--max_steps`: The total number of training steps.
-   `--save_steps`: The number of steps between saving checkpoints.
-   `--use_lora`: Whether to use LoRA for training. This also accepts `--lora_rank`, `--lora_alpha`, and `--lora_dropout` parameters. LoRA is applied by default to the 'q\_proj', 'k\_proj', 'v\_proj', 'o\_proj' parameters. If you need to change this, modify it in the code. Note: **When using LoRA for training, only the LoRA weights are saved, not the base model weights**. If you need to merge LoRA weights, see the "LoRA Weight Merging" section below.
-   `--make_moe_param_leaf_module`: When using zero3 and MoE training, treat the MoE module as a leaf module, meaning its parameters are not split by zero3. This option is expected to significantly increase memory usage.
-   `--gradient_checkpointing`: Enable gradient checkpointing.
-   `--train_attention_params_only`: Whether to train only the attention parameters.
-   `--learning_rate`: The maximum learning rate during training.
-   `--min_lr`: The minimum learning rate during training.
-   `--use_flash_attn`: 开启 flash-attention 进行训练加速

**Note:**

-   If you want to continue training from a previously saved checkpoint instead of loading pre-trained weights, specify `--resume_from_checkpoint` with the path to the checkpoint from the previous training. Do not specify `--model_name_or_path`, as this will only load the weights and not the training state.
-   When continuing training from a checkpoint, there might be slight deviations in loss due to randomness introduced by some non-deterministic algorithms, which is considered normal. Refer to: HuggingFace Transformers Trainer Randomness
-   When `--model_name_or_path` is specified, all model-related parameters will be ignored.
-   Samples within a batch will be padded to align with the longest sample in the batch, with each sample having a maximum length of `max_seq_length`. Any excess will be truncated.
-   If you encounter warnings about bias weights not being loaded, you can ignore them, as biases are not used in Hunyuan-Large.

#### What to Do If Out of Memory?

Refer to: DeepSpeed Configuration

You can try modifying the DeepSpeed configuration by removing the auto attribute from these parameters and reducing their values:

-   `stage3_param_persistence_threshold`
-   `stage3_prefetch_bucket_size`
-   `stage3_max_reuse_distance`
-   `stage3_max_reuse_distance`

#### Merging LoRA Models

The saved LoRA weights cannot be merged into the zero3 model during training because, with zero3 enabled, model weights are split across different data parallel ranks. If you want to merge LoRA weights into the base model, you can do so offline to obtain the merged weight file. Execute `merge_lora_weight.sh` to merge the LoRA weights with the base model weights. The parameters include:

-   `--base_model_path`: Directory of the base model weights
-   `--adapter_model_path`: Directory of the LoRA weights
-   `--output_path`: Directory to save the merged weights
-   `--save_dtype`: Data format for storing the merged weights, available options include: fp16, bf16, fp32

Inference and Deployment
------------------------

HunyuanLLM uses TRT-LLM and vLLM for deployment. We are open sourcing the vLLM-backend deployment (see Reasoning with vLLM), and the TRT-LLM deployment (see Reasoning with TRT-LLM) will be available in the near future.

Using TRT-LLM for Inference
---------------------------

To be opened

Using vLLM for Inference
------------------------

### Docker:

To simplify the deployment process, HunyuanLLM provides a pre-built Docker image:

hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large. You only need to download the model files and start the Docker container using the code below to begin model inference.

docker run --name hunyuanLLM\_infer -itd --privileged --user root --net=host --ipc=host --gpus=8 hunyuaninfer/hunyuan-large:infer-open-source

Note: Docker container privilege management. The above code uses privileged mode (`--privileged`) to start the Docker container, which grants the container higher privileges, increasing the risk of data leakage and cluster security threats. It is recommended to avoid using privileged mode unless necessary to reduce security risks. For scenarios where privileged mode is required, conduct a thorough security assessment and implement appropriate security monitoring and hardening measures.

### Configure Passwordless SSH Login Between Machines

The following steps use two machines as an example, with their IPs represented as `${ip1}` and `${ip2}`. These operations are performed within a Docker container.

First, run `passwd` on both machines to set a password, for example: `Tmp123,./`

Copy `inference/login_ssh.py` into the container and execute the following command, ensuring the IP and password are correctly entered.

python3 login\_ssh.py --ips ${ip1},${ip2} --port 36000 --password=Tmp123,./

**Note 📢: Before starting, be sure to verify multi-machine communication using VLLM's debugging script: https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting\_started/debugging.html**

### BF16 Deployment

BF16 requires 16 H20 GPUs for deployment. After verifying that multi-machine communication is correct, execute the following steps:

Before running the commands, set the following environment variables:

${LOCAL\_IP}: The IP corresponding to bond1 on the current machine
${MODEL\_PATH}: Path to the Hunyuan LLM model

#### Step 1: Start Ray

Ray is an open-source library for parallel and distributed Python. In this section, we use Ray to achieve multi-machine communication.

Ray Component Configuration Hardening: The default configuration of Ray components does not enable authentication mechanisms for service ports (e.g., 6379, 8265), posing risks of unauthorized access and command execution. It is recommended to deploy Ray components only in trusted internal network environments or ensure strict access control list (ACL) policies are implemented for these ports to prevent unauthorized network access.

First, start Ray on each node (either in the background or by keeping the terminal running):

On the head node:

export VLLM\_HOST\_IP=${LOCAL\_IP}
export NCCL\_SOCKET\_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO\_SOCKET\_IFNAME=bond1
ray start --block --head --node-ip-address=${LOCAL\_IP} --port=6379

On all worker nodes:

Note: Replace `{HEAD NODE $LOCAL_IP}` with the actual `${LOCAL_IP}` of the head node.

export VLLM\_HOST\_IP=${LOCAL\_IP}
export NCCL\_SOCKET\_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO\_SOCKET\_IFNAME=bond1
ray start --block --address={HEAD NODE $LOCAL\_IP}:6379 --node-ip-address=${LOCAL\_IP}

If Ray fails to start, execute `ray stop` and then run the above commands again.

#### Step 2: Execute Inference

#### Method 1: Command Line Inference

Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to quickly request the chat model using `vLLM`:

Note: vLLM Component Remote Code Execution Protection. In the code below, if the `trust-remote-code` configuration option of the vLLM component is enabled, it will allow loading and executing code from remote model repositories, which may lead to the execution of malicious code. Unless explicitly required by business needs, it is recommended to keep this configuration option disabled to reduce potential security threats.

import os
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

model\_path\=os.environ.get('MODEL\_PATH')

llm \= LLM(model\=model\_path,

for output in outputs:
    prompt \= output.prompt
    generated\_text \= output.outputs\[0\].text
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated\_text!r}")

#### Method 2: Service-Based Inference

Below we demonstrate how to deploy the model using `vLLM` in a service-based manner and make requests.

Run the following on the head node:

export VLLM\_HOST\_IP=${LOCAL\_IP}
export NCCL\_SOCKET\_IFNAME=bond1
export GLOO\_SOCKET\_IFNAME=bond1

Next, start the service by running:

cd inference
sh run\_server.sh

_Tips_: Troubleshooting, if you encounter the following error:

ray.exceptions.RaySystemError: System error: No module named 'transformers\_modules' traceback: Traceback (most recent call last):
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers\_modules'

Copy the `~/.cache/huggingface/modules/` directory from the head node to the corresponding path on all worker nodes.

After successfully running `run_server.sh`, execute the request script:

sh openapi.sh

Be sure to modify `${LOCAL_IP}` and `${MODEL_PATH}` in `openapi.sh` to values match the corresponding service.

### Quantized Model Deployment:

This section describes the process of deploying a quantized model using vLLM.

Image: The deployment image is the same as for BF16.

#### Int8 Quantized Model Deployment:

To deploy the Int8-weight-only version of the Hunyuan-L model, simply set the environment variables in `run_server_int8.sh`:

${MODEL\_PATH}: Path to the BF16 model
${LOCAL\_IP}: The IP corresponding to bond1 on the current machine

Then, start the Int8 service by running:

sh run\_server\_int8.sh

After successfully running `run_server_int8.sh`, execute the request script:

sh openapi.sh

#### FP8 Quantized Model Deployment:

To deploy the W8A8C8 version of the Hunyuan-L model, simply set the environment variables in `run_server_fp8.sh`:

${MODEL\_PATH}: Path to the FP8 model
${LOCAL\_IP}: The IP corresponding to bond1 on the current machine

Then, start the FP8 service by running:

sh run\_server\_fp8.sh

After successfully running `run_server_fp8.sh`, execute the request script:

sh openapi.sh

Tokenizer
---------

The tokenizer used in the HunYuan-Large model balances compression rate and effectiveness, ensuring that embeddings are sufficiently trained. The vocabulary includes 100K tokens integrated from tiktoken. Additionally, we trained an extra 29K Chinese tokens using a large amount of high-quality Chinese training data to enhance the model's Chinese capabilities and the tokenizer's compression rate. Combined, our new tokenizer improves the compression rate compared to the LLaMA3 tokenizer, increasing from 2.78 characters/token to 3.13 characters/token.
