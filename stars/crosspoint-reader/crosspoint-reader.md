# CrossPoint Reader

CrossPoint is open-source e-reader firmware - community-built, fully hackable, free forever. It's maintained by a growing community of developers and readers who believe your device should do what you want - not what a manufacturer decided for you.

**Now running on:** ESP32C3-based Xteink [X4](https://www.xteink.com/products/xteink-x4) and [X3](https://www.xteink.com/products/xteink-x3).

## What can CrossPoint do?

- **Reader engine**: EPUB 2/3 rendering with embedded-style option, image handling, hyphenation, kerning, chapter navigation, footnotes, go-to-percent, auto page turn, orientation control, focus reading, KOReader progress sync and more. 

- **Various formats**: native handling for `.epub`, `.xtc/.xtch`, `.txt`, and `.bmp`.

- **Screenshots.**

- **Custom fonts**: install your favorite fonts on the SD card.

- **Tilt page turn (X3 only)**.

- **Library workflow**: folder browser, hidden-file toggle, long-press delete, recent books, SD-cache management.

- **Wireless workflows**:
  
  - File transfer web UI
  - EPUB Optimizer
  - Web settings UI/API (edit many device settings from browser)
  - WebSocket fast uploads
  - WebDAV handler
  - AP mode (hotspot) and STA mode (join existing WiFi), both with QR helpers
  - Calibre wireless connect flow
  - OPDS browser with saved servers (up to 8), search, pagination, and direct download
  - OTA update checks and installs from GitHub releases

- **Customization**: multiple themes (Classic, Lyra, Lyra Extended, RoundedRaff), sleep screen modes, front/side button remapping, status bar controls, power-button behavior, refresh cadence, and more.

- **Localization**: 22 UI languages and counting.

### Coming soon:

- RTL support — Arabic, Hebrew, and Farsi.

- Bookmarks.

## USB-locked devices (Xteink Unlocker)

Some Xteink units purchased from third-party stores (e.g. AliExpress) ship with USB flashing locked from the factory.
If your device is locked, you will need to use the **Xteink Unlocker** tool available at
https://crosspointreader.com/#unlock-tool before you can flash CrossPoint.

**You do not need this tool if you bought your device directly from xteink.com.** Those units are not locked.

**Not sure if your device is locked?** Power it on, connect the USB-C cable, and try flashing via the web flasher first (see
[Install firmware](#install-firmware) below). If the browser's serial device picker does not show your device, try a different
USB port or browser before assuming the device is locked. Only reach for the unlocker if the device still doesn't appear.

> ### ⚠️ WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE USING THE UNLOCKER ⚠️
> 
> **The only officially supported firmwares in the unlock tool are CrossPoint and CrossInk.**
> 
> Flashing any other firmware on a USB-locked device may **permanently brick the device** or leave it **permanently
> stuck on that firmware with no recovery path**. Once USB flashing is re-locked, your only way back is via OTA, and if
> the firmware you flashed doesn't support OTA, **there is no way out**.
> 
> **The Papyrix fork has removed OTA update support from its code.** If you flash Papyrix onto a
> USB-locked unit, you will have **zero update or recovery path** and will be stuck on it forever. **Do not flash
> Papyrix (or any other unsupported firmware) on a locked device.**

## Install firmware

### Web installer (recommended)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), and choose an official CrossPoint release.

### Web installer (specific version)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Download a `firmware.bin` from [Releases](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases), local build, or continuous integration artifact.
3. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), click "Custom .bin" and upload a `firmware.bin`.

### Revert to Official Firmware

To revert to the official firmware, you can also flash the latest official firmware using https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools.

### Command line

1. Install [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool):

```bash
pip install esptool
```

2. Download `firmware.bin` from the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases).
3. Connect your device via USB-C.
4. Find the device port. On Linux, run `dmesg` after connecting. On macOS:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.iokit"' --info
```

5. Flash:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 /path/to/firmware.bin
```

Adjust `/dev/ttyACM0` to match your system.

## Development quick start

### Prerequisites

- [pioarduino](https://github.com/pioarduino/pioarduino) or VS Code + pioarduino plugin
- Python 3.8+
- `clang-format` 21
- USB-C cable supporting data transfer

### Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader
cd crosspoint-reader

# if cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build / flash / monitor

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### Contributor pre-PR checks

```bash
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check -e default
pio run -e default
```

### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it’s recommended to capture detailed logs from the serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```

After that run the script:

```sh
# For Linux
# This was tested on Debian and should work on most Linux systems.
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# For macOS
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```

Minor adjustments may be required for Windows.

## Internals

CrossPoint Reader is pretty aggressive about caching data down to the SD card to minimise RAM usage. The ESP32-C3 only has ~380KB of usable RAM, so we have to be careful. A lot of the decisions made in the design of the firmware were based on this constraint.

### Data caching

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card. Subsequent loads are served from the 
cache. This cache directory exists at `.crosspoint` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:

```text
.crosspoint/
├── epub_<hash>/         # one directory per book, named by content hash
│   ├── progress.bin     # reading position (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # generated cover image
│   ├── book.bin         # metadata: title, author, spine, TOC
│   └── sections/        # per-chapter layout cache
│       ├── 0.bin
│       ├── 1.bin
│       └── ...
```

Removing `/.crosspoint` clears all cached metadata and forces a full regeneration on next open. Note: the cache isn't cleared automatically when you delete a book, and moving a file to a new path resets its reading progress.

For more details on the internal file structures, see the [file formats document](./docs/file-formats.md).

## Community forks

One of the best things about open source is that anyone can take the code in a different direction. If you need something outside CrossPoint's [scope](./SCOPE.md), check out the community forks:

- [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk) — Typography and reading tracking: Bionic Reading (bolds word stems to create fixation points), guide dots between words, improved paragraph indents, and replaces the default fonts with ChareInk/Lexend/Bitter.

- [papyrix-reader](https://github.com/bigbag/papyrix-reader) — Adds FB2 and MD format support. Actively maintained with Arabic script support. Custom themes via SD card.

- [crosspet](https://github.com/trilwu/crosspet) — A Vietnamese fork that adds a Tamagotchi-style virtual chicken that grows based on your reading milestones (pages read, streaks, care). Also: Flashcards, Weather, Pomodoro timer, and mini-games.

- [crosspoint-reader (jpirnay)](https://github.com/jpirnay/crosspoint-reader) — Faster integration of functionality. Tracks upstream PRs and integrates the good ones ahead of the official merge.

- [crosspoint-reader-cjk](https://github.com/aBER0724/crosspoint-reader-cjk) — Purpose-built for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean reading.

- [inx](https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx) — Completely reimagines the user interface with tabbed navigation.

- ~~[PlusPoint](https://github.com/ngxson/pluspoint-reader) — custom JS apps support.~~ (Unmaintained)

- [crosspoint-reader-papers3](https://github.com/juicecultus/crosspoint-reader-papers3) — Crosspoint port for M5Stack Paper S3. 

**Note:** Many of these features will make their way into CrossPoint over time. We maintain a slower pace to ensure rock-solid stability and squash bugs before they reach your device.
