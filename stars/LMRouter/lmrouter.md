# LMRouter

**LMRouter** is an open-source, all-in-one API router that gives AI developers a single, unified way to connect to the best model providers.

With LMRouter, you don’t need to create accounts on multiple platforms or juggle different API keys. A **single API key** unlocks access to **any provider, any model, any service**, all through one interface.

It’s an **open-source alternative to OpenRouter**, but goes far beyond language models. LMRouter supports multiple modalities and services out of the box:

- **Language**: Chat Completions, Responses API, Anthropic Messages
- **Image**: Image generation and editing
- **Audio**: Speech-to-text and audio models
- **Video**: Video generation (coming soon)
- **Embeddings**: Semantic search and RAG
- **Search**: Jina, Exa, and other web search APIs (coming soon)
- **Code**: Execution with interpreters such as e2b (coming soon)

## Quick Start

LMRouter service is available at [lmrouter.com](https://lmrouter.com). Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.lmrouter.com/) for more information.

### Local Development/Deployment

To setup LMRouter locally, make sure you have Node.js and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed, then follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LMRouter/lmrouter
cd lmrouter
pnpm i
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
```

Edit `config/config.yaml` to set up your own provider and model configurations.

```bash
# Run the server in development mode
pnpm dev

# Run the server in production mode
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Alternatively, you can use `pnpx` to run the server:

```bash
pnpx @lmrouter/cli /path/to/config.yaml
```

## Features
