## Why Tutti

macOS gives you a volume slider, a device list, and a tiny speaker glyph — and that's it. You can't play to two speakers at once, can't set a different volume per app, can't EQ one app without touching the rest. Tutti is the control center that fills the gap: one panel for every output, every app, and every level — riding Apple's own audio frameworks, with nothing installed into your system.

## 📱 Tutti Remote — now on the App Store

**Control your Mac's audio from your iPhone.** Sit on the couch and switch presets, pick output speakers, set per-device and per-app volume, and drive playback from an iPod-style click wheel. Pairs over your local network; the Mac stays in charge. The iPhone app is free; controlling your Mac needs Tutti Pro there.

## Features

### Multi-device output
- **Play to every speaker at once** — tick multiple outputs and Tutti builds a CoreAudio Aggregate Device on the fly, keeping them clock-synced.
- **Or just one** — pick a single device and Tutti switches the system default directly, no aggregate created.
- **Master + per-device volume & mute** — one slider for everything, plus an individual slider and mute for each output.
- **Three-state status** — playing on all, partially muted, or all muted, with a matching color dot.
- **Hot-swap without a gap** — add or remove a speaker mid-playback without cutting the sound.
- **Device Guard** — set a priority order for your outputs and lock the default output, input, and volume; when macOS or another app switches them behind your back, Tutti puts them back.
- **Remembers your setup** — your speaker group, per-device volumes, and mute survive quitting Tutti and app updates.

### Per-app audio control &nbsp;`macOS 14.4+`
- **Per-app volume & Turbo** &nbsp;`Free` — give each app its own level; Turbo adds a 2× boost. Driver-free, via a native audio tap.
- **Per-app equalizer** &nbsp;`Free` — a draggable 6-band EQ curve for any app, or a built-in preset.
- **Per-app output** &nbsp;`Pro` — send different apps to different speakers; keep a call on the laptop while music fills the room.
- **See where sound goes** — output devices show small badges of the apps routed to them.
- **Ignore apps you don't manage** — right-click any app to tuck it out of the list.

### Pro power tools
- **Presets** &nbsp;`Pro` — save device + volume + per-app combos and switch with one click; each gets its own emoji.
- **Global keyboard shortcuts** &nbsp;`Pro` — hotkeys to open the panel, mute, switch preset, or nudge an app's volume from inside any app.
- **Stereo pairing across devices** &nbsp;`Pro` — send the left channel to one speaker and the right to another — two speakers, one stereo pair.
- **Per-speaker left-right balance** &nbsp;`Pro` — lean any speaker's sound toward one side when it sits off-center.
- **Per-device latency tuning** &nbsp;`Pro` — dial in a small delay, by ear, for a Bluetooth speaker that trails the others.
- **Desktop widgets** &nbsp;`Pro` — status, devices, volume, and presets on your desktop, no app open.

### Now Playing & media
- **Now Playing card** — song, artwork, and play/pause/skip for Spotify or Apple Music, right in the panel.
- **Steps aside for calls & video** &nbsp;`Free` — fades and pauses your music when a call or video plays, then fades back at the same volume.
- **Microphone input card** — pick the input device, adjust its level, or mute it from the panel.

### Bluetooth & sync
- **Reconnects on its own** — a grouped Bluetooth speaker that briefly drops out rejoins when it reconnects, no interruption.
- **Hands back after headphones** — put your AirPods away and Tutti returns to the speaker group and preset you were using.
- **Headphone battery** — shown next to the device name when reported; AirPods get their own icon.
- **Keeps headphones crisp after calls** — uses the built-in mic on calls so your headset doesn't stay stuck at muffled call quality.
- **Stays in sync** — clock-drift correction keeps wired and Bluetooth speakers aligned instead of drifting apart.

### Menu bar, shortcuts & the little things
- **Menu bar quick menu** — device toggles, preset switching, and mute-all without opening the panel.
- **Volume takeover** — keyboard volume keys and the scroll wheel drive the aggregate output globally.
- **Shortcuts, Siri & Spotlight** — switch presets, mute, or set the volume from your automations.
- **Scroll where you point** — hover a device, app, or the mic and the wheel adjusts just that one.
- **Pick your menu bar icon** — classic sound waves or one of ten instruments; the icon fills as volume rises.
- **Sleep timer · gentle fades · Light / Dark / System · launch at login · automatic updates** — the conveniences you'd expect.

### On the way
- **Raycast extension** &nbsp;`Coming soon` — mute, set volume, and switch presets from Raycast.

## How Tutti compares

Other great Mac audio tools each solve a piece of this. Here's where Tutti stands.

¹ Per-app features use a native macOS audio tap; requires macOS 14.4 or later.

² Tutti's multi-output uses a CoreAudio Aggregate Device and per-app control uses the native tap — nothing extra is installed. Background Music installs a virtual audio device; SoundSource requires its ARK plugin.

³ On macOS 14.4 or later, Audio Hijack uses native system audio access without installing an additional audio component.

⁴ Audio Hijack provides these capabilities through configurable sessions rather than a menu-bar mixer.

Competitor capabilities checked against the current documentation for [Background Music](https://github.com/kyleneideck/BackgroundMusic), [FineTune](https://github.com/ronitsingh10/FineTune), [SoundSource 6](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/whatsnew.php), and [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/support/manuals/audiohijack/).

## Use cases

- **Shared listening** — living room speaker and Bluetooth headphones at the same time; play out loud while a friend wears headphones.
- **Streaming & recording** — monitor through headphones while broadcasting to an audience or a capture card.
- **Multi-room playback** — drive wired speakers in the living room and another pair in the bedroom from one Mac.
- **Couch control** — switch presets and pick speakers from your iPhone without getting up.
- **Teaching** — the teacher hears prompts in headphones while the classroom speaker plays for students.

## AirPlay & known limitations

- **AirPlay can't join a group** — macOS won't let AirPlay receivers (HomePod, Apple TV, AirPlay speakers) play in a multi-output group, and only first-party apps can start an AirPlay route. Tutti can use an AirPlay device on its own once macOS has routed to it. See [Roadmap](#roadmap).
- **Per-app features need macOS 14.4+** — per-app volume, Turbo, EQ, and routing rely on the Core Audio process tap added in 14.4. On macOS 13–14.3 everything else works.
- **Bluetooth battery depends on the device** — the level appears only for headsets that report it to macOS.

## Roadmap

- **AirPlay routing inside Tutti** — picking and switching AirPlay receivers straight from the panel, without going to Control Center first. macOS keeps AirPlay discovery on a first-party-only track today; the moment that opens up, Tutti will too.

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Accessibility permission only for the keyboard volume-key takeover (the scroll path doesn't need it)

## Localization

Simplified Chinese · Traditional Chinese · English · Japanese · Korean · French · German · Italian · Spanish.
