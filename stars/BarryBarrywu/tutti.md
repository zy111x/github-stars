## Why Tutti?

### Give each speaker a part

Play through several outputs together, then tune them individually. Send the left channel to one speaker and the right to another, adjust each device's balance, or add delay to faster outputs to match a slower one. Delay tuning cannot make Bluetooth audio arrive sooner.

### Switch your sound and screens together

Save your audio outputs, volumes, app settings, display selection, and brightness as one preset. A movie setup can use your speakers and dimmer screens; a work setup can restore different outputs and brightness. Resolution, refresh rate, and main-display changes remain local manual controls and are not saved in presets.

### Stay in control from the couch

Use [Tutti Remote](https://apps.apple.com/app/tutti-remote/id6788375184) on your iPhone to choose outputs, adjust device and app volume, control music playback, or change display brightness over your local network.

## One panel for everyday controls

- **Apps:** individual volume, six-band EQ and Turbo boost, with per-app output routing.
- **Displays:** individual or grouped brightness, Follow Built-in, resolution, refresh rate, existing HiDPI modes, and main-display selection. Brightness upscaling is available on eligible screens.
- **The rest of your desk:** microphone controls, Now Playing for Apple Music and Spotify, and Device Guard for preferred audio devices and volume.

See the [full feature list and interactive demo](https://tutti.barrybarrywu.com/).

## Tutti in your day

### From work desk to movie night

Work with headphones and screens set for reading. When it's time for a movie, switch to a preset you've saved to select your speakers, restore their volume, and dim your displays together. Once you're on the couch, adjust volume and brightness from your iPhone.

### Headphones for you, speakers for the lesson

During a lesson or rehearsal, play the same backing track through headphones and speakers: follow the music in your headphones while students practice along with the speakers. Adjust headphone and speaker volume separately. If one output plays ahead of the other, add delay to the faster one, then save your usual setup as a preset.

### Turn down one app, keep the rest as they are

Keep music playing quietly while you work. If a video in your browser is suddenly too loud, turn down the browser in Tutti without changing the music or your Mac's overall volume. Give each app a level that feels right.

### Two speakers, a left and a right

Assign the left channel to the speaker on one side of your desk and the right channel to the other, then adjust their volumes to balance what you hear. If one plays later, add delay to the faster output to align them by ear. Save the combination as a preset.

### Clearer by day, gentler at night

Outdoors or beside a bright window, your screen can be hard to see even at maximum brightness. Enable Brightness Upscaling on an eligible display to make it easier to read. At bedtime with the lights off, the lowest brightness may still feel too bright; Extra Dim can lower supported screens below their normal hardware minimum.

Both adjustments can affect color accuracy; turn them off for color-critical editing.

## Install

[Download the latest DMG](https://github.com/BarryBarrywu/tutti/releases/latest/download/Tutti.dmg), move Tutti to Applications, and open it. Or install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask barrybarrywu/tap/tutti
```

Click the menu bar icon and select the outputs you want to use. Select more than one for multi-output playback, then adjust the group volume or each output separately. Tutti checks for updates automatically; [release notes](https://github.com/BarryBarrywu/tutti/releases) describe what's changed.

## Free & Pro

**Free, without a time limit:** multi-output playback, device volume, per-app volume, Turbo and EQ, plus local display brightness and display-mode controls on supported macOS versions.

**Pro adds:** presets, per-app output routing, stereo pairing, per-device balance and latency tuning, global shortcuts, desktop widgets, Raycast control, iPhone remote control, and eligible display brightness upscaling.

Tutti Remote is free to download on iPhone; controlling your Mac requires Tutti Pro on the Mac.

**$12.99 one-time, no subscription.** Includes a 7-day Pro trial, one active Mac per license, and a 14-day refund policy. When the trial ends, free features keep working. [Compare plans and get Pro](https://tutti.barrybarrywu.com/#pricing).

## Control from anywhere

- **[Tutti Remote for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/app/tutti-remote/id6788375184)** — control outputs, device and app volume, music playback, and display brightness over your local network.
- **[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/Barrybarrywu/tutti)** — set volume, mute, or apply a preset.
- **Shortcuts, Siri & Spotlight** — use Tutti actions to switch presets, mute, or set volume in your workflows. See the [setup guide](https://tutti.barrybarrywu.com/docs/).

<summary><strong>Compare Tutti, SoundSource, FineTune, and BetterDisplay</strong></summary>

Choose by the workflow you need. Tutti combines audio and display controls; the alternatives below also offer capabilities outside Tutti's scope.

| Workflow | Tutti | SoundSource 6 | FineTune | BetterDisplay 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-output playback | Yes; stereo split, balance and delay tuning | Output groups, including AirPlay | Multi-device routing | Not listed |
| Per-app volume / EQ / routing | Volume + 6-band EQ + routing | Volume + 10-band EQ + routing | Volume + 10-band EQ + routing | Not listed |
| Display control | Brightness, existing display modes and upscaling | Not listed | Not listed | Brightness, flexible HiDPI, virtual screens and more |
| Combined audio + display-brightness presets | Yes | Not listed | Not listed | Not listed |
| Companion iPhone remote | Tutti Remote | Not listed | Not listed | Not listed |
| Other strengths | Sound and brightness in one panel | AirPlay groups; Audio Unit effects | AutoEQ headphone correction; open-source | Custom resolutions, virtual displays, PIP and 3D LUTs |
| Installation | No virtual audio driver or system extension | ARK plugin + audio permissions | App + audio capture permission | App installation |

“Not listed” means the cited official documentation does not advertise that workflow; it is not a tested claim that the capability is impossible. This is a documentation comparison, not a performance or hardware-compatibility test. Tutti's system and display requirements still apply.

Checked September 19, 2026: [SoundSource features](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/), [installation requirements](https://rogueamoeba.com/support/manuals/soundsource/?page=Permissions), [FineTune features and setup](https://github.com/ronitsingh10/FineTune#readme), and [BetterDisplay features](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay#readme).

## Compatibility & support

| Capability | Requires |
|---|---|
| Multi-output audio and device controls | macOS 13+ |
| Per-app volume, Turbo, EQ and routing | macOS 14.4+ |
| Display controls | macOS 15+; available controls depend on the display and connection |

AirPlay receivers cannot join Tutti's multi-output groups. Bluetooth outputs may need latency tuning; adding delay cannot make a slow output arrive sooner. Keyboard volume- and brightness-key takeover requires Accessibility permission.

Brightness upscaling depends on the display's EDR headroom and connection. It can affect HDR content and color accuracy; Tutti does not detect HDR content or automatically disable gain. Group controls, keys, scrolling, Remote, and automation stay within 100%. Read the [compatibility and setup guide](https://tutti.barrybarrywu.com/docs/#upscaling) before enabling it.
