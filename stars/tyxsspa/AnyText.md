‚è∞TODOs
------

-   Release the model and inference code
-   Provide publicly accessible demo link
-   Provide a free font file(ü§î)
-   Release tools for merging weights from community models or LoRAs
-   Support AnyText in stable-diffusion-webui(ü§î)
-   Release AnyText-benchmark dataset and evaluation code
-   Release AnyWord-3M dataset and training code

üí°Methodology
-------------

AnyText comprises a diffusion pipeline with two primary elements: an auxiliary latent module and a text embedding module. The former uses inputs like text glyph, position, and masked image to generate latent features for text generation or editing. The latter employs an OCR model for encoding stroke data as embeddings, which blend with image caption embeddings from the tokenizer to generate texts that seamlessly integrate with the background. We employed text-control diffusion loss and text perceptual loss for training to further enhance writing accuracy.

üõ†Installation
--------------

# Install git (skip if already done)
conda install -c anaconda git
# Clone anytext code
git clone https://github.com/tyxsspa/AnyText.git
cd AnyText
# Prepare a font file; Arial Unicode MS is recommended, \*\*you need to download it on your own\*\*
mv your/path/to/arialuni.ttf ./font/Arial\_Unicode.ttf
# Create a new environment and install packages as follows:
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate anytext

üîÆInference
-----------

**\[Recommend\]**Ôºö We release a demo on ModelScope and HuggingFace! You can also try AnyText through our API service.

AnyText include two modes: Text Generation and Text Editing. Running the simple code below to perform inference in both modes and verify whether the environment is correctly installed.

python inference.py

If you have advanced GPU (with at least 8G memory), it is recommended to deploy our demo as below, which includes usage instruction, user interface and abundant examples.

export CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=0 && python demo.py

FP16 inference is used as default, and a Chinese-to-English translation model is loaded for direct input of Chinese prompt (occupying ~4GB of GPU memory). The default behavior can be modified, as the following command enables FP32 inference and disables the translation model:

export CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=0 && python demo.py --use\_fp32 --no\_translator

If FP16 is used and the translation model not used(or load it on CPU, see here), generation of one single 512x512 image will occupy ~7.5GB of GPU memory.  
In addition, other font file can be used by(although the result may not be optimal):

export CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=0 && python demo.py --font\_path your/path/to/font/file.ttf

You can also load a specified AnyText checkpoint:

export CUDA\_VISIBLE\_DEVICES=0 && python demo.py --model\_path your/path/to/your/own/anytext.ckpt

**Please note** that when executing inference for the first time, the model files will be downloaded to: `~/.cache/modelscope/hub`. If you need to modify the download directory, you can manually specify the environment variable: `MODELSCOPE_CACHE`.

In this demo, you can change the style during inference by either change the base model or loading LoRA models(must based on SD1.5):

-   Change base model: Simply fill in your local base model's path in the \[Base Model Path\].
-   Load LoRA models: Input your LoRA model's path and weight ratio into the \[LoRA Path and Ratio\]. For example: `/path/of/lora1.pth 0.3 /path/of/lora2.safetensors 0.6`.

üìàEvaluation
------------

### 1\. Data Preparation

Download the AnyText-benchmark dataset from ModelScope or GoogleDrive and unzip the files. In _benchmark_ folder, _laion\_word_ and _wukong\_word_ are datasets for English and Chinese evaluation, respectively. Open each _test1k.json_ and modify the `data_root` with your own path of _imgs_ folder. The _FID_ directory contains images that are used for calculating the FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) score.

### 2\. Generate Images

Before evaluation, we need to generate corresponding images for each method based on the evaluation set. We have also provided pre-generated images for all methods. Follow the instructions below to generate images on you own. Note that you need modify the paths and other parameters in the bash script accordingly.

-   AnyText

bash ./eval/gen\_imgs\_anytext.sh

ÔºàIf you encounter an error caused by huggingface being blocked, please uncomment line 98 of ./models\_yaml/anytext\_sd15.yaml, and replace the path of the _clip-vit-large-patch14_ folder with a local oneÔºâ

-   ControlNet, Textdiffuser, GlyphControl  
    We use glyph images rendered from AnyText-benchmark dataset as conditional input for these methods:

bash eval/gen\_glyph.sh

Next, please clone the official repositories of **ControlNet**, **Textdiffuser**, and **GlyphControl**, and follow their documentation to set up the environment, download the respective checkpoints, and ensure that inference can be executed normally. Then, copy the three files `<method>_singleGPU.py`, `<method>_multiGPUs.py`, and `gen_imgs_<method>.sh` from the _./eval_ folder to the root directory of the corresponding codebases, and run:

bash gen\_imgs\_<method\>.sh

### 3\. Evaluate

We use Sentence Accuracy (Sen. ACC) and Normalized Edit Distance (NED) to evaluate the accuracy of generated text. Please run:

bash eval/eval\_ocr.sh

We use the FID metric to assess the quality of generated images. Please run:

bash eval/eval\_fid.sh

Compared to existing methods, AnyText has a significant advantage in both English and Chinese text generation.  
Please note that we have reorganized the code and have further aligned the configuration for each method under evaluation. As a result, there may be minor numerical differences compared to those reported in the original paper.

üöÇTraining
----------

1.  It is highly recommended to create and activate the `anytext` virtual environment from previous instructions, where the versions of libraries are verified. Otherwise, if you encounter an environmental dependency or training issue, please check if it matches with the versions as listed in `environment.yaml`.
2.  Download training dataset **AnyWord-3M** from ModelScope, unzip all \*.zip files in each subfolder, then open _\*.json_ and modify the `data_root` with your own path of _imgs_ folder for each sub dataset.
3.  Download SD1.5 checkpoint from HuggingFace, then run `python tool_add_anytext.py` to get an anytext pretrained model.
4.  Run `python train.py`.  
    **Note**: Training AnyText on 8xA100 (80GB) takes ~312 hours, you can also quickly reproduce it with 200k images, which takes ~60 hours on 8xV100(32GB). Enable Perceptual Loss will consume a significant amount of VRAM and reduce the training speed. Additionally, filtering out images containing watermarks will lower the likelihood of generating watermarks. These two steps are usually activated in the last 1 or 2 epochs. Relevant parameters can be found in the `Configs` within train.py, please check carefully.  
    The metrics we achieved using 200k images for reproduce are as follows. Note that these metrics are significantly higher than those reported in the original paper because we used V1.1 data and code. For more details, see Appendix 7 of the original paper.
