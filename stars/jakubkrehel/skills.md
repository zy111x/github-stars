[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/jakubkrehel/skills)](https://skills.sh/jakubkrehel/skills)

A collection of agent skills that help you build a great interface. They cover UI, typography, colors, accessibility, layout, product writing and more.

## Skills

- [**better-interface**](skills/better-interface/SKILL.md): A cross-discipline interface review that coordinates every skill below.
- [**interface-review**](skills/interface-review/SKILL.md): A user-invoked review of your uncommitted changes, current branch or a pull request against every skill below. Run it by name; it never starts on its own.
- [**variant**](skills/variant/SKILL.md): Builds several genuinely different versions of one piece of UI behind a picker, so you can flip between them in the real page and promote the one that wins. Run it by name.
- [**explain-interface**](skills/explain-interface/SKILL.md): Ask how something was built. Point it at a URL or a screenshot, name the thing you're curious about, and it finds the layers behind the effect and explains what each one does. Run it by name.
- [**better-ui**](skills/better-ui/SKILL.md): Design engineering details that make interfaces feel polished: border radius, shadows, animations and micro-interactions.
- [**better-typography**](skills/better-typography/SKILL.md): Choosing and pairing typefaces, type scales, spacing, wrapping and truncation.
- [**better-colors**](skills/better-colors/SKILL.md): Color systems: building and naming palettes, applying color with meaning, contrast and theming.
- [**better-accessibility**](skills/better-accessibility/SKILL.md): Focus states, keyboard support, ARIA, forms, screen readers, hit areas and motion.
- [**better-layout**](skills/better-layout/SKILL.md): Layout structure, grouping, alignment, reading order, progressive disclosure and adaptive breakpoints.
- [**better-writing**](skills/better-writing/SKILL.md): UX writing and interface copy, from button labels to errors, settings and empty states.

## Install

Both methods install the same skills. They differ in what you type to run one, so pick a method and use its names.

### CLI

Works in Claude Code, Codex, Opencode and other agents. You can choose which skills to install or install all of them.

```bash
npx skills add jakubkrehel/skills
```

Skills installed this way keep their plain names, so the change review runs as `/interface-review`.

### Claude Code plugin

Installs every skill in this repository together and updates in place. Run these inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add jakubkrehel/skills
/plugin install interfaces@interfaces
```

Plugin skills are namespaced under the plugin, so the change review runs as `/interfaces:interface-review` and variants as `/interfaces:variant`.

To update later, run `/plugin update interfaces@interfaces` and restart.
