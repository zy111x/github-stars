[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/jakubkrehel/skills)](https://skills.sh/jakubkrehel/skills)

A collection of agent skills that help you build a great interface. They cover UI, typography, colors, accessibility, layout, product writing and more.

## Skills

- [**better-interface**](skills/better-interface/SKILL.md): A cross-discipline interface review that coordinates every skill below.
- [**interface-review**](skills/interface-review/SKILL.md): A user-invoked review of your uncommitted changes, current branch or a pull request against every skill below. Run it by name; it never starts on its own.
- [**better-ui**](skills/better-ui/SKILL.md): Design engineering details that make interfaces feel polished: border radius, shadows, animations and micro-interactions.
- [**better-typography**](skills/better-typography/SKILL.md): Web typography from choosing fonts to spacing, wrapping and accessibility.
- [**better-colors**](skills/better-colors/SKILL.md): Color systems: building and naming palettes, applying color with meaning, contrast and theming.
- [**better-accessibility**](skills/better-accessibility/SKILL.md): Focus states, keyboard support, ARIA, forms, screen readers, hit areas and motion.
- [**better-layout**](skills/better-layout/SKILL.md): Layout structure, grouping, alignment, reading order, progressive disclosure and adaptive breakpoints.
- [**better-writing**](skills/better-writing/SKILL.md): UX writing and interface copy, from button labels to errors, settings and empty states.
