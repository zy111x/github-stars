# magpie

One place to pick every agent's model: Codex on DeepSeek, Claude Code
on Kimi, Gemini CLI on GLM, from the menu bar. [usemagpie.ai](https://usemagpie.ai)

`magpie` is a single screen that lists each AI agent on your machine and
the model it is set to. Click a value, pick a model. That is the whole app.

It lives in the menu bar: click the icon and a panel drops down; the same
screen also opens as a normal window (`magpie`, or *Open magpie* in the tray menu),
and there is a terminal version (`magpie tui`) and a plain CLI.

- **One small binary.** Under 15 MB with the desktop app (it uses the system
  webview through [Wails](https://wails.io), nothing bundled), 7 MB for the
  terminal-only build. macOS, Linux and Windows.
- **Edits config files surgically.** Only the one key you change is touched;
  comments, ordering and indentation in your `settings.json`, `config.toml`,
  `opencode.jsonc` or `config.yaml` survive intact. Writes are atomic.
- **One endpoint for every agent.** magpie runs a local gateway that speaks
  OpenAI chat completions, OpenAI Responses and the Anthropic Messages API,
  and forwards to whichever vendor serves the model. Codex, Claude Code,
  OpenCode and the rest all point at `http://127.0.0.1:3425/v1` and pick
  from one catalog; the translation between APIs happens in magpie, streaming
  and tool calls included.
- **Your subscriptions, shared.** Sign in to Claude Code, Codex (ChatGPT)
  or Copilot and that login shows up as a provider: every other agent can
  use its models through the gateway, with nothing copied and no key to
  paste.
- **Providers with one field.** Pick a preset (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini,
  DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, Qwen, Mistral, Groq, xAI, OpenRouter,
  Together, Fireworks, SiliconFlow, AiHubMix, 302.AI, Ollama, LM Studio…),
  paste a key, done. Custom vendors need a name and a base URL. magpie never
  reads keys from your shell environment.
- **Real model lists, nothing compiled in.** With a key in hand magpie asks
  the vendor which models it serves and offers exactly those; the
  [models.dev](https://models.dev) catalog fills in names, reasoning efforts
  and the list for vendors that have none, and refreshes itself in the
  background once it goes stale. Choose which models each provider exposes,
  or expose them all — a model released this morning is in the picker on
  the next refresh.
- **Profiles.** Snapshot every agent's settings under a name and switch all of
  them back in one move.
- **Real logos, no framework.** Plain HTML over the system webview; brand
  icons from [lobehub/icons](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons).

## Agents

| Agent        | File                              | Fields          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Claude Code  | `~/.claude/settings.json`         | provider, model, opus/sonnet/haiku/fable (through magpie) |
| Codex        | `~/.codex/config.toml`            | provider, model, effort |
| Gemini CLI   | `~/.gemini/settings.json`, `~/.gemini/.env` | auth, model |
| OpenCode     | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json(c)` | model, small |
| Pi           | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`       | model           |
| Goose        | `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`     | model           |
| Cursor CLI   | `~/.cursor/cli-config.json`       | model           |
| Copilot CLI  | `~/.copilot/settings.json`        | model           |
| Crush        | `~/.config/crush/crush.json`      | large, small    |
| DeepSeek Harness (dsh) | `~/.dsh/config.yaml` (`$DSH_HOME`) | model |
| Command Code | `~/.commandcode/settings.json` (+ `providers.json`) | model |
| omp (oh-my-pi) | `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` (+ `models.yml`) | model |
| Devin        | `~/.config/devin/config.json` (`%APPDATA%\devin\config.json` on Windows) | model |
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (`$HERMES_HOME`) | model |
| Cline (CLI)  | `~/.cline/data/settings/providers.json` (`$CLINE_DIR`) | model, effort (magpie takes its openai-compatible provider) |
| Qoder (CLI)  | `~/.qoder/settings.json` (`$QODER_CONFIG_DIR`) | model, effort (a `magpie` custom provider; needs a Qoder plan with BYOK) |
| Grok Build   | `~/.grok/config.toml` (`$GROK_HOME`) | model, effort |
| ZCode        | `~/.zcode/v2/config.json`         | provider (magpie's models in ZCode's picker) |
| Alma         | Alma's local API (`localhost:23001`, while Alma runs) | model (Alma's default; magpie's models as a provider) |

Provider-scoped agents (OpenCode, Pi, Goose, Crush, omp, Hermes Agent) take `provider/model`.
Only agents that are installed or configured are shown.

## Providers and the gateway

Every model an agent can pick is spelled `provider/model` and served by
magpie's gateway, so agents never hold vendor keys or vendor URLs. Add a
provider, and its models appear in every agent's picker:

```sh
magpie presets                          # the vendors magpie knows, grouped: vendors, relays, local
magpie provider add deepseek sk-…       # a preset needs only the key
magpie provider add ollama              # local servers need none
magpie provider add "My Relay" url=https://relay.example.com/v1 key=sk-… models=gpt-5.5,claude-sonnet-5
magpie providers                        # host, key, exposed models, who uses what
magpie provider deepseek                # one provider in detail
magpie provider models deepseek         # re-fetch the vendor's list (add ids to choose which to expose)
magpie provider test deepseek           # one tiny request per API, with latency
magpie provider key deepseek sk-…       # replace the key
magpie provider rm deepseek
magpie models                           # the catalog agents see
magpie claude deepseek/deepseek-chat    # use it
```

Custom providers take `url=` (an OpenAI-compatible base), `anthropic=` (an
Anthropic-compatible base), or both, plus `responses=` when the vendor has a
separate Responses endpoint, `catalog=` to borrow a models.dev list, and
`models=` to name the models to expose. Anything a preset does not know can
be overridden the same way.

### Routing groups

A routing group is several models, from one provider or many, that an agent
picks as one: `group/<id>`. The gateway routes each request over every
member's keys and accounts together. A model two of your providers serve
under the same name becomes a group on its own; the Routing view in the app
and `magpie group` make any other:

```sh
magpie groups                           # yours, then those magpie found
magpie group add "Opus anywhere" models=claude/claude-opus-5-5,copilot/claude-opus-5.5 routing=order stays=session
magpie group opus-anywhere              # one group, its models in order
magpie group set opus-anywhere models+=openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-5.5 routing=usage
magpie group set opus-anywhere models-=copilot/claude-opus-5.5
magpie group rm opus-anywhere           # one magpie found is hidden; magpie group restore <id> brings it back
magpie claude group/opus-anywhere       # use it
```

`routing=` is `smart` (the default: of the subscriptions with quota to
spare, the one whose allowance renews soonest first), `order` (the first
model until it can't answer, then the next), `rotate` (each turn to the next
member) or `usage` (least used first). `stays=` is how long a conversation
stays with the key or account that answered it: `auto` (the default, while
the vendor's cache of it is worth keeping), `session`, `turn` or `off`.
`models=` replaces the whole list, in order; a bare model id works when only
one provider serves it.

The app's Import from other apps dialog can copy providers from Claude Code's
`settings.json` (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set) and Codex's `config.toml`
(`CODEX_HOME` when set) into magpie. Codex imports custom
`[model_providers.*]` entries with an inline `experimental_bearer_token`,
including fixed headers for custom providers in
`[model_providers.*.http_headers]` and models from
`[profiles.*]` or `model_catalog_json`. Review the entries before importing;
subsequent changes to agent settings are not automatically copied to magpie.
Entries that point back to magpie or only name an `env_key` are skipped.

### Signed-in agents as providers

An agent you have signed in to is a subscription with models behind it, so
magpie offers it as a provider too. Claude Code (an OAuth login in the macOS
Keychain or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`), Codex (a ChatGPT login in
`~/.codex/auth.json`), Copilot (a GitHub login in
`~/.config/github-copilot/apps.json`) and Devin (`devin auth login`, kept in
`~/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml`) appear in `magpie providers` and in
the Providers tab as *signed in as …*, with their models spelled
`claude/claude-sonnet-5`, `codex/gpt-5.5`, `copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5` or
`devin/swe-2-max` in every other agent's picker. magpie reads the agent's own credentials each
time, refreshes tokens the way the agent does — writing a rotated token
back where the agent will find it — and stores nothing but your model
picks; sign out of the agent and the provider is gone. The model list is
the vendor's own too: magpie asks Anthropic's, Copilot's or Codex's API with
that same sign-in, so a model added upstream appears on the next refresh.
The ChatGPT backend only streams and rejects a few parameters, so magpie
translates non-streaming requests and drops what it would refuse.
Claude subscriptions are different: Anthropic classifies another agent's
system prompt as third-party traffic even when the OAuth request otherwise
looks like Claude Code. magpie therefore drives the genuine local `claude`
binary for every Claude subscription generation. The caller's tools are
bridged into that live turn over MCP, and tool results resume the same Claude
Code process; Pi, OpenCode and every other agent use this path automatically.
The generated harness stays out of Anthropic's system-prompt classifier while
its instructions remain part of the user context. This requires Claude Code
to be installed and signed in.
Cursor, Grok (SuperGrok, through Grok Build) and Devin subscriptions likewise run through their own CLIs —
none of them has an endpoint a borrowed key can be sent to — with Devin
driven over ACP (`devin acp`) in a home of magpie's own that keeps only the
caller's MCP tools and shares just the sign-in.
Google sign-ins — Gemini CLI's and Antigravity's — talk to Google's Code
Assist API directly: magpie reads Gemini CLI's own login from `~/.gemini` or
signs one in itself, and refreshes the token in memory. Google no longer
serves Gemini CLI's sign-in to individual accounts, only to Gemini Code
Assist Standard and Enterprise, which need a Google Cloud project named
(`magpie accounts project gemini <email> <project-id>`, or
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` in `~/.gemini/.env`). Google may suspend an
Antigravity account it sees used outside Antigravity, so magpie asks before
adding one; use an account you can afford to lose.

### Connecting anything else

The gateway listens on `127.0.0.1:3425` (`MAGPIE_ADDR` changes it) and starts
with the app; `magpie serve` runs it alone. It exposes:

| Path                     | API                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `/v1/chat/completions`   | OpenAI chat completions    |
| `/v1/responses`          | OpenAI Responses           |
| `/v1/messages`           | Anthropic Messages         |
| `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | Anthropic token counting |
| `/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` | Google Gemini (also `:streamGenerateContent`, `:countTokens`) |
| `/v1/models`, `/v1beta/models` | the catalog            |

Each `/v1/models` entry includes `reasoning` and `supported_reasoning_levels`
(`[{"effort":"low"}, ...]`). A routing group lists only the levels every
member supports.

Requests pass straight through when the vendor speaks the agent's API and
are translated otherwise, streaming, tool calls and reasoning included. The
key is `magpie` (any value works; the gateway only listens on loopback), and
models are named `provider/model`. Anything with a base-URL setting can use
it:

| Tool speaks | Base URL                   | Environment                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI      | `http://127.0.0.1:3425/v1` | `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY=magpie`      |
| Anthropic   | `http://127.0.0.1:3425`    | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=magpie` |
| Gemini      | `http://127.0.0.1:3425`    | `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY=magpie` |

The *Gateway* tab in the app has this as copy buttons and ready-made
snippets (shell, curl, Python, Node) for each API, the list of model ids,
and the recent calls; `MAGPIE_DEBUG=1` logs every call to the terminal.

**Claude Code** gets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and the
model variables in the `env` block of `settings.json`; picking a native
model (`opus`, `sonnet`…) removes them and restores whatever was there.

**Codex** gets a `[model_providers.magpie]` table, `model_catalog_json`
pointing at `~/.codex/magpie-models.json` (written from the catalog, so the
models show in Codex's own list) and a valid `model`/`effort`; picking a
native model removes all of that. Your ChatGPT sign-in is never touched.
Codex reads its model list at start-up, so restart it after a switch.

**OpenCode, Pi, Crush** get a `magpie` provider entry and `magpie/provider/model`.

**Gemini CLI** switches `auth` between API key, Google account and Vertex;
the API key goes to `~/.gemini/.env`. Picking a catalog model points
`GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` at the gateway (which speaks the Gemini API), sets
`auth` to API key with the gateway token, and names the model in
`settings.json`; a native model puts the previous auth back.

### Import links

A vendor or relay can hand its users a ready-made provider as a link:

```
magpie://import?preset=deepseek&key=sk-…
magpie://import?name=Acme%20Relay&chat=https://api.acme.example/v1&anthropic=https://api.acme.example&key=sk-…&models=gpt-5.5,claude-sonnet-5
```

Opening one brings up magpie with what the link would add: the name, the
hosts your prompts and key would go to, the models. Nothing is saved until
you press *Add*. `magpie import <link>` does the same in a terminal.

| Parameter   | Meaning                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `preset`    | a preset id (`magpie presets`); its endpoints are used             |
| `region`    | with a preset that has regions, which one                          |
| `name`      | the provider's name; required without a preset                     |
| `id`        | its id; derived from the name when absent                          |
| `key`       | the API key; the user pastes one when absent                       |
| `chat`      | OpenAI Chat Completions base URL (`…/v1`)                          |
| `responses` | OpenAI Responses base URL (`…/v1`)                                 |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Messages base URL (the root, without `/v1`)              |
| `models`    | model ids to expose, comma separated                               |
| `catalog`   | models.dev provider id, for model names and reasoning levels       |
| `website`, `keys` | the vendor's site and its API-key page (https)               |
| `icon`      | an https picture of the vendor's own (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, ICO, SVG, at most 1 MB). magpie downloads it once, after you confirm the import, into its icons folder; without one it falls back to the catalog's logo or a plain mark |

Base URLs must be https (plain http only to this machine or the local
network). Web pages and GitHub don't link custom schemes reliably, so link
to `https://usemagpie.ai/import#<same parameters>` instead: it opens
magpie, and offers the download when it is not installed. The parameters
stay in the fragment, which browsers never send to a server. The full guide,
with a link builder: <https://usemagpie.ai/docs/import>.

## Install

Download the app for macOS, Windows or Linux from
[usemagpie.ai](https://usemagpie.ai), or install it from a terminal (on
Linux, the desktop app when WebKitGTK 4.1 is installed, the command
otherwise):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://usemagpie.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Mac releases are signed and notarised; the Windows and Linux builds are not
signed yet (Windows SmartScreen may ask before the first run). Every build
keeps itself current: the app
downloads a new version in the background and installs it when you restart
(*Restart to Update* in the menu) or quit; `magpie update` does the same from
a terminal. Every release is on
[yetone/magpie-releases](https://github.com/yetone/magpie-releases/releases).

From source:

```sh
go install github.com/yetone/magpie@latest
```

or build locally:

```sh
make build            # ./magpie with the desktop app (needs cgo + the platform webview)
make app              # macOS: magpie.app, a menu bar app with no Dock icon
make cli              # terminal-only build, no cgo, cross-compiles anywhere
make release          # dist/: native app build + cli builds for every platform
make release-windows  # dist/: the Windows app, amd64 and arm64 (cross-compiles)
make release-linux    # dist/: the Linux app for this machine's arch
```

Linux needs `libgtk-3-dev` and `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` for the app build
(the Makefile adds the `gtk3` tag; with plain `go build`, pass `-tags gtk3`);
Windows uses the WebView2 runtime that ships with the OS.

### Developing

```sh
make dev
```

builds with `-tags dev` and opens the app with the UI served straight from
`internal/gui/assets`: save `app.css`, `app.js` or `index.html` and the window
reloads itself. With `fswatch` installed (`brew install fswatch`), a change to a
Go file rebuilds and relaunches the app too. The dev build uses its own gateway
port (`DEV_ADDR`, default 127.0.0.1:3426), so a magpie you already run keeps
serving your agents. Point it at a scratch home to keep your real agent
configs out of it:

```sh
HOME=/tmp/magpie-home XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/magpie-home/.config make dev
```

`MAGPIE_THEME=light|dark` forces the palette and `MAGPIE_DEBUG=1` prints what the
gateway translates.

## Use

```sh
magpie                          # open the app: a window plus the menu bar icon
magpie tray                     # menu bar icon only (use this in your login items)
magpie tui                      # the same thing, in the terminal
magpie ls                       # list every agent and its current settings
magpie claude opus              # set a model (agent names accept prefixes: cc, oc, gem …)
magpie codex gpt-5.6-sol
magpie codex effort high        # other fields
magpie codex xhigh              # bare effort levels are recognised too
magpie codex deepseek/deepseek-chat   # any catalog model, through the gateway
magpie claude moonshot/kimi-k2.5
magpie claude haiku deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash   # one tier on its own model
magpie claude haiku ""          # back to the main model
magpie gemini auth api-key
magpie opencode anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
magpie oc small anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5

magpie save work                # snapshot everything as a profile
magpie use work                 # switch back
magpie profiles
magpie rm work

magpie sync                     # refresh the models.dev catalog and every live model list
```

In the app, click any value to open a filtered list; type to search or to
enter something that is not listed; `esc` closes the panel. Profiles are the
chips at the bottom: click to apply, `×` to delete, *+ save current* to add.
The *Providers* tab of the window lists your providers with the agents on
each; click a row to change the key or the exposed models, *Test* it, or
click an agent icon to point that agent at one of its models. *Add
provider* shows the presets as tiles: pick one, paste the key.

Keys in the terminal version:

| Key        | Action                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `↑` `↓`    | choose agent                          |
| `←` `→`    | choose field (model, effort, small …) |
| `↵`        | open the picker                       |
| type       | filter; enter accepts custom values   |
| `s`        | save current setup as a profile       |
| `p`        | apply or delete (`ctrl+d`) a profile  |
| `S`        | sync the model catalog                |
| `q`        | quit                                  |

Agents read their config at startup, so a running session keeps its model
until you start a new one.

### Moving to another machine

```sh
magpie backup                   # writes magpie.magpie-backup, asks for a passphrase twice
magpie backup --no-keys ~/b.magpie-backup   # the same with no API keys in it
magpie restore magpie.magpie-backup         # on the other machine
magpie restore --no-agents b.magpie-backup  # providers, settings, profiles; agents left as they are
```

A backup holds your providers (with their keys, unless `--no-keys`), the
pictures picked for them, the settings, the profiles and every agent's model.
It is encrypted on your machine (AES-256-GCM, the key derived from the
passphrase with PBKDF2-SHA256); nothing in it can be read without the
passphrase. Restoring replaces providers with the same id and adds the rest;
one that came without a key keeps the key already there. Agent models are set
only for agents installed on that machine. Subscriptions are not in it: sign
in to them on each machine. Piped in, the passphrase is the first line of
stdin.

## Files

- `~/.config/magpie/profiles.json` — saved profiles
- `~/.config/magpie/providers.json` — your providers, keys included (0600)
- `~/.config/magpie/stash.json` — values magpie replaced, restored on switch-back
- `~/.cache/magpie/models.json` — models.dev catalog (OpenCode's cache at
  `~/.cache/opencode/models.json` is used when present)
- `~/.cache/magpie/models/<provider>.json` — model lists fetched from vendors

`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` are respected.
