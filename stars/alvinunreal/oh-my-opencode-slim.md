## What's This Plugin

oh-my-opencode-slim is an agent orchestration plugin for OpenCode. It includes a built-in team of specialized agents that can scout a codebase, look up fresh documentation, review architecture, handle UI work, and execute well-scoped implementation tasks under one orchestrator.

The main idea is simple: instead of forcing one model to do everything, the plugin routes each part of the job to the agent best suited for it, balancing **quality, speed and cost**.

To explore the agents themselves, see **[Meet the Pantheon](#meet-the-pantheon)**. For the full feature set, see **[Features & Workflows](#features-and-workflows)** below.

### Quick Start

Copy and paste this prompt to your LLM agent (Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, etc.):


```
Install and configure oh-my-opencode-slim: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim/refs/heads/master/README.md
```


### Manual Installation

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install
```

### Getting Started

The installer generates an OpenAI preset by default, using `openai/gpt-5.5` for the higher-judgment agents and `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` for the faster scoped agents.

Then:

1. **Log in to the providers you want to use if you haven't already**:

   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   ```
2. **Refresh and list the models OpenCode can see**:

   ```bash
   opencode models --refresh
   ```
3. **Open your plugin config** at `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`

4. **Update the models you want for each agent**

> [!TIP]
> Want to understand how automatic delegation works in practice? Review the **[Orchestrator prompt](https://github.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim/blob/master/src/agents/orchestrator.ts#L28)** — it contains the delegation rules, specialist routing logic, and the thresholds for when the main agent should hand work off to subagents.

The default generated configuration looks like this:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/oh-my-opencode-slim@latest/oh-my-opencode-slim.schema.json",
  "preset": "openai",
  "presets": {
    "openai": {
      "orchestrator": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.5", "skills": ["*"], "mcps": ["*", "!context7"] },
      "oracle": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.5", "variant": "high", "skills": ["simplify"], "mcps": [] },
      "librarian": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini", "variant": "low", "skills": [], "mcps": ["websearch", "context7", "grep_app"] },
      "explorer": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini", "variant": "low", "skills": [], "mcps": [] },
      "designer": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini", "variant": "medium", "skills": ["agent-browser"], "mcps": [] },
      "fixer": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-mini", "variant": "low", "skills": [], "mcps": [] }
    }
  }
}
```

Session management is enabled by default even though it is not shown in the
starter config. See **[Session Management](docs/session-management.md)** if you
want to customize how many resumable child-agent sessions are remembered.

### For Alternative Providers

To use Kimi, GitHub Copilot, ZAI Coding Plan, or a mixed-provider setup, use **[Configuration](docs/configuration.md)** for the full reference. If you want a ready-made starting point, check the **[Author's Preset](docs/authors-preset.md)** and **[$30 Preset](docs/thirty-dollars-preset.md)** - the `$30` preset is the best cheap setup.

The configuration guide also covers custom subagents via `agents.<name>`, where
you can define both a normal `prompt` and an `orchestratorPrompt` block for
delegation.

You can also mix and match any models per agent. For model suggestions, see the **Recommended Models** listed under each agent below.

### ✅ Verify Your Setup

After installation and authentication, verify all agents are configured and responding:

```bash
opencode
```

Then run:

```
ping all agents
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/ping.png" alt="Ping all agents" width="600">
  <p><i>Confirmation that all configured agents are online and ready.</i></p>
</div>

If any agent fails to respond, check your provider authentication and config file.

### 04. Council: The Chorus of Minds

> [!NOTE]
> **Why doesn't Orchestrator auto-call Council more often?** This is intentional. Council runs multiple models at once, so automatic delegation is kept strict because it is usually the highest-cost path in the system. In practice, Council is meant to be used manually when you want it, for example: <code>@council compare these two architectures</code>.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%" align="center" valign="top">
      <img src="img/council.png" width="240" style="border-radius: 10px;">
      <br><sub><i>Many minds, one verdict.</i></sub>
    </td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">
      The Council is not a lone being but a chamber of minds summoned when one answer is not enough. It sends your question to multiple models in parallel, gathers their competing judgments, and then the Council agent itself distills the strongest ideas into a single verdict. Where a solitary agent may miss a path, the Council cross-examines possibility itself.

## Optional Agents

### Observer: The Silent Witness

> [!NOTE]
> **Why a separate agent?** If your Orchestrator model is not multimodal, enable Observer to handle images, screenshots, PDFs, and other visual files. Observer is disabled by default and gives the Orchestrator a dedicated multimodal reader without forcing you to change your main reasoning model. Set `disabled_agents: []` and an `observer` model in your configuration.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%" align="center" valign="top">
      <img src="img/observer.jpg" width="240" style="border-radius: 10px;">
      <br><sub><i>The eye that reads what others cannot.</i></sub>
    </td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">

**Read-only visual analysis** — interprets images, screenshots, PDFs, and diagrams. Returns structured observations to the orchestrator without loading raw file bytes into the main context window.

- Images, screenshots, diagrams → `read` tool (native image support)
- PDFs and binary documents → `read` tool (text + structure extraction)
- **Disabled by default** — enable with `"disabled_agents": []` and configure a vision-capable model
