## What's This Plugin

oh-my-opencode-slim is an agent orchestration plugin for OpenCode. It includes a built-in team of specialized agents that can scout a codebase, look up fresh documentation, review architecture, handle UI work, and execute well-scoped implementation tasks under one orchestrator.

The main idea is simple: instead of forcing one model to do everything, the plugin routes each part of the job to the agent best suited for it, balancing **quality, speed and cost**. The Orchestrator plans the work graph, dispatches specialists as background tasks, and reconciles their results before continuing.

### ✨ Highlights

- **[Seven specialized agents](#meet-the-pantheon)** - Orchestrator, Explorer,
  Oracle, Council, Librarian, Designer, and Fixer. Each part of the job goes to
  the agent best suited for it - mix any models across any providers.
- **[Background orchestration](docs/background-orchestration.md)** - the
  Orchestrator dispatches specialists as background tasks, tracks them, and
  reconciles results before continuing - parallel work by default.
- **[Bundled skills](#skills)** - prompt-based workflows like `deepwork`,
  `codemap`, `verification-planning`, and `reflect`, assigned per agent.
- **[Council](docs/council.md)** - run multiple models in parallel on the same
  question and synthesize a single answer with `@council`.
- **[Companion](docs/companion.md)** - an optional floating desktop window
  showing which agents are active, including parallel background specialists.
- **[Multiplexer integration](docs/multiplexer-integration.md)** - watch agents
  work live in Tmux, Zellij, Herdr, cmux, or kitty panes.
- **[Preset switching](docs/preset-switching.md)** - swap the whole team's
  models at runtime with `/preset`.
- **[Code intelligence tools](docs/tools.md)** - LSP tools, AST-aware search
  across 25 languages, and built-in MCPs for web search, docs, and GitHub code
  search.
- **[Fully customizable](docs/configuration.md)** - custom agents, prompt
  overrides, per-agent skill/MCP permissions, and
  [project-local customization](docs/project-local-customization.md).

</p>

The default [OpenAI preset](docs/openai-preset.md) maps Terra to Orchestrator,
Sol to Oracle, and Luna to the fast specialist lanes.

### What Users Say

> “Task management went from 5/10 to 8-9/10 easily. The Orchestrator sends
> Fixers and Explorers, and I can still talk and plan with the Orchestrator in
> the same session. The experience feels way smoother now.”
>
> \- `vipor_idk`

> “I ditched all my harnesses for this beta version of omo-slim and don't look
> back or miss anything. Great work and IMHO all in the right direction.”
>
> \- `stephanschielke`

> “I love omo-slim, and can't imagine running opencode without it. I love that I
> can create a Frankenstein of models... Makes the setup such a beast.”
>
> \- `Capital-One3039`

> “It has significantly improved my workflow... Now, it is working very
> smoothly, and I love it.”
>
> \- `xenstar1`

### Quick Start

Copy and paste this prompt to your LLM agent (Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, etc.):


```
Install and configure oh-my-opencode-slim: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim/refs/heads/master/README.md
```


### Manual Installation

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install
```

The published CLI is a Node-compatible bundle, so `npx` works too if you don't
have Bun installed:

```bash
npx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install
```

### Run from Master

Use this if you want the latest code, easier bug fixes, or a local setup for
development and contributions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim.git ~/repos/oh-my-opencode-slim
cd ~/repos/oh-my-opencode-slim
bun install
bun run build
bun dist/cli/index.js install
```

The installer adds the local repo path to the `plugin` array in
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, so OpenCode loads the plugin from that
folder. To update later:

```bash
cd ~/repos/oh-my-opencode-slim
git pull
bun install
bun run build
```

### Getting Started

The installer generates both OpenAI and OpenCode Go presets, with OpenAI active by default.

> [!TIP]
> Tune the models and agents for your own workflow. The defaults are only a
> starting point; the plugin is designed for deep flexibility and customization.

To make OpenCode Go active during install, run `bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --preset=opencode-go` or change the default preset name in `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` after installation.

Then:

1. **Log in to the providers you want to use if you haven't already**:

   ```bash
   opencode auth login
   ```
2. **Refresh and list the models OpenCode can see**:

   ```bash
   opencode models --refresh
   ```
3. **Open your plugin config** at `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`

4. **Update the models you want for each agent**

> [!TIP]
> It's **recommended** to understand how background orchestration works. The **[Orchestrator prompt](https://github.com/alvinunreal/oh-my-opencode-slim/blob/master/src/agents/orchestrator.ts#L28)** contains the scheduler rules, specialist routing logic, and thresholds for when work should be assigned to background agents. You can always delegate manually by calling a subagent via: `@agentName <task>`

> [!TIP]
> Because background agents are now the default workflow, it is **highly recommended** to enable and configure **[Multiplexer Integration](docs/multiplexer-integration.md)**. It automatically opens each agent in a dedicated Tmux, Zellij, Herdr, cmux, or kitty pane, so you can watch specialists work live while the Orchestrator continues coordinating the session.

The default generated configuration includes both `openai` and `opencode-go` presets.

### Preset Docs

- **[OpenAI Preset](docs/openai-preset.md)** — the default generated preset; runs all agents on OpenAI models.
- **[OpenCode Go Preset](docs/opencode-go-preset.md)** — runs the agents on OpenCode Go models; enables the Observer agent for visual analysis since its orchestrator model isn't multimodal.
- **[Author's Preset](docs/authors-preset.md)** — the exact config the author runs day to day, with third-party skills.
- **[$30 Preset](docs/thirty-dollars-preset.md)** — a mixed-provider setup built around Codex Plus and GitHub Copilot Pro for about $30/month.
- **[OpenCode Zen Free Preset](docs/opencode-zen-free-preset.md)** — every agent runs on an opencode free model; no usage cost.

### For Alternative Providers

To use custom providers or a mixed-provider setup, use **[Configuration](docs/configuration.md)** for the full reference.

### ✅ Verify Your Setup

After installation and authentication, verify all agents are configured and responding:

```bash
opencode
```

Then run:

```
ping all agents
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/ping.png" alt="Ping all agents" width="600">
  <p><i>Confirmation that all configured agents are online and ready.</i></p>
</div>

If any agent fails to respond, check your provider authentication and config file.

### 04. Council: The Chorus of Minds

> [!NOTE]
> **Why doesn't Orchestrator auto-call Council more often?** This is intentional. Council runs multiple models at once, so automatic delegation is kept strict because it is usually the highest-cost path in the system. In practice, Council is meant to be used manually when you want it, for example: <code>@council compare these two architectures</code>.

    </td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">
      The Council is not a lone being but a chamber of minds summoned when one answer is not enough. It sends your question to multiple models in parallel, gathers their competing judgments, and then the Council agent itself distills the strongest ideas into a single verdict. Where a solitary agent may miss a path, the Council cross-examines possibility itself.

## Optional Agents

### Observer: The Silent Witness

> [!NOTE]
> **Why a separate agent?** If your Orchestrator model is not multimodal, enable Observer to handle images, screenshots, and other visual files. Observer is disabled by default and gives the Orchestrator a dedicated multimodal reader without forcing you to change your main reasoning model. Set `disabled_agents: []` and an `observer` model in your configuration. The bundled `opencode-go` install preset does this automatically because its GLM Orchestrator is not multimodal. Omitting `image_routing` preserves existing conditional Observer behavior. Set `image_routing: "auto"` only when Observer is enabled, or `"direct"` to always pass image attachments to the Orchestrator.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%" align="center" valign="top">
      <img src="img/observer.jpg" width="240" style="border-radius: 10px;">

    </td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">

**Read-only visual analysis** - interprets images, screenshots, PDFs, and diagrams. Returns structured observations to the orchestrator without loading raw file bytes into the main context window.

- PDFs and binary documents → `read` tool (text + structure extraction)
- **Disabled by default** - enable with `"disabled_agents": []` and configure a vision-capable model; installing with `--preset=opencode-go` enables it with `opencode-go/mimo-v2.5`. Image attachments route to Observer by default when it is enabled; set `"image_routing": "direct"` to keep them on the Orchestrator.

## 🧩 Skills

Skills are prompt-based instructions injected into an agent's system prompt to
guide decisions, workflows, and tool use. Unlike MCPs (which are running
servers), a skill runs no process — it is a focused playbook an agent activates
when the task calls for it. The installer bundles eight skills and keeps them
updated on plugin auto-update; local customizations are preserved.

> [!TIP]
> To discard local bundled-skill customizations and receive package updates, run
> `bunx oh-my-opencode-slim install --skills=force`. This deliberately replaces
> installed bundled skills with the package versions.

Skill assignments are permission grants — an agent can only activate skills it
has been given. Configure them per agent with the `skills` array in
`~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json`: an explicit list, `"*"` for
everything, or `"!skill-name"` to deny one.

See **[Skills](docs/skills.md)** for full documentation, or browse the
illustrated overview at
**[ohmyopencodeslim.com/skills](https://ohmyopencodeslim.com/skills)**.

## 🖥️ Companion

The optional Companion is a floating desktop status window for live agent
activity. It shows the current session state and which agents are active, so
background work is easier to follow at a glance.

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/companion.gif" alt="Companion showing active agents" width="600">
  <p><i>Left bottom visual companion.</i></p>
</div>

During interactive install, the installer asks whether to enable Companion and
defaults to `no`. For automation, enable it explicitly with:

```bash
bunx oh-my-opencode-slim@latest install --companion=yes
```

See **[Companion](docs/companion.md)** for configuration, positions, sizes, and
install details.
