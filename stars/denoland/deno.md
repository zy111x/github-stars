### Build and install from source

Complete instructions for building Deno from source can be found in the manual here.

Your first Deno program
-----------------------

Deno can be used for many different applications, but is most commonly used to build web servers. Create a file called `server.ts` and include the following TypeScript code:

Deno.serve((\_req: Request) \=> {
  return new Response("Hello, world!");
});

Run your server with the following command:

deno run --allow-net server.ts

This should start a local web server on http://localhost:8000.
