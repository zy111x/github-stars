# opencode-with-claude

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Use [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) with your [Claude Max](https://claude.ai) subscription.

## What this is

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that runs [Meridian](https://github.com/rynfar/meridian) *(formerly opencode-claude-max-proxy)* for you: **start OpenCode once** and the proxy comes up with it; **quit OpenCode** and the proxy stops. No separate proxy CLI or Docker container to manage.

**Compared to running the proxy yourself:**

- **One process to think about** — OpenCode owns the proxy lifecycle (start/stop) instead of you juggling two things.
- **Several OpenCode windows at once** — each instance gets its own proxy on an OS-assigned port, so ports do not collide and you avoid session issues from sharing one proxy across instances.
- **Explicit session headers** — the plugin adds session tracking on outgoing API calls, so the proxy does not have to infer sessions from fingerprints alone.

## How It Works

```

## Quick Start

The plugin hooks into OpenCode's plugin system. When OpenCode launches, it starts the proxy, configures the Anthropic provider, and cleans everything up on exit.

**1. Install the plugin**

```bash
npm install -g opencode-with-claude
```

**2. Authenticate with Claude (one-time)**

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth login 
```

**3. Add to your `opencode.json`**

Global (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) or project-level:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-with-claude"],
  "provider": {
    "anthropic": {
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:3456",
        "apiKey": "dummy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Run OpenCode**

```bash
opencode
```

## Profiles and SDK features

The plugin now reads the same Meridian configuration files the `meridian` CLI
uses, so you can maintain multiple Claude accounts and tune SDK behavior
without leaving OpenCode.

### Profiles (`~/.config/meridian/profiles.json`)

Define one or more named profiles (for example, a personal Claude Max account
and a work account). The plugin forwards them to Meridian at startup.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "personal",
    "claudeConfigDir": "/Users/me/.config/meridian/profiles/personal"
  },
  {
    "id": "work",
    "claudeConfigDir": "/Users/me/.config/meridian/profiles/work"
  }
]
```

### Active profile (`~/.config/meridian/settings.json`)

```json
{ "activeProfile": "work" }
```

`activeProfile` selects the default profile for any request that does not send
an explicit `x-meridian-profile` header. If the saved id is not in
`profiles.json` (or the file is missing), the plugin logs a warning and falls
back to the first configured profile.

### SDK features (`~/.config/meridian/sdk-features.json`)

Meridian reads this file lazily on every request, so overrides take effect
without restarting the proxy. The plugin does not need to do anything special
for it to work — just edit the file and the next request picks it up. See
Meridian's documentation for the full list of adapter keys.

This plugin does not edit Meridian's SDK feature file. When Meridian's default
client prompt pass-through is enabled, the plugin scrubs OpenCode-identifying
prompt fingerprints with `@rynfar/meridian-plugin-opencode-scrub` before
forwarding. User context such as `AGENTS.md` and configured instructions is
preserved, while cwd is forwarded to Meridian through the process environment.

```json
{
  "opencode": {
    "memory": true,
    "thinking": "enabled",
    "maxBudgetUsd": 0.5
  }
}
```

### Environment overrides

For parity with the `meridian` CLI:

- `MERIDIAN_PROFILES` — JSON array of profile objects; wins over `profiles.json`.
- `MERIDIAN_DEFAULT_PROFILE` — profile id; wins over `settings.activeProfile`.

Malformed or missing files never crash the plugin; all parse/IO failures are
logged via OpenCode's plugin log and the plugin falls back to no-profile mode.

### Switching profiles at runtime

Profile switching through Meridian's HTTP API continues to work — call
`POST /profiles/active` on the proxy URL the plugin prints at startup. The
selection is persisted back to `settings.json` and survives restarts.

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude Code CLI not found"

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### "Claude not authenticated"

```bash
claude auth login
# or (depends of your version)
claude login
```

This opens a browser for OAuth. Your Claude Max subscription credentials are needed.

### "Proxy failed to start"

1. Check Claude auth: `claude auth status`
2. Ensure your internet connection is working
3. If using a manual port override, check if it's in use: `lsof -i :$CLAUDE_PROXY_PORT`

### Binding the proxy to a non-localhost interface

Meridian binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. If you need it to listen on another
interface, set `CLAUDE_PROXY_HOST` (or Meridian's `MERIDIAN_HOST` alias) before
starting OpenCode:

```bash
CLAUDE_PROXY_HOST=0.0.0.0 opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4098
```

The plugin still uses loopback internally when you bind to wildcard addresses
such as `0.0.0.0` or `::`, so local health checks and provider requests remain
stable.

Warning

Exposing the proxy beyond localhost makes your authenticated Claude session
reachable over the network. Only do this on trusted networks, and prefer
firewall rules or other access controls if you open it up.

## FAQ

**Do I need an Anthropic API key?**

No. Claude Max is not authenticated with API keys here. Run `claude login` once; the proxy uses that session (Agent SDK via OAuth). OpenCode still expects an `apiKey` field in the Anthropic provider config, so set a placeholder such as `"dummy"` in `opencode.json` — it is not used for real auth.

**What if my Claude Max subscription lapses?**

The proxy will fail to authenticate. Run `claude auth status`. You need an active Claude Max plan; see [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) for current options and pricing.

**Can I run several OpenCode instances at once?**

Yes. The first instance uses port **3456** by default; others get a free OS-assigned port, so nothing extra to configure.

**Is this the same as using the Anthropic API directly?**

Not exactly. OpenCode speaks Anthropic-style HTTP to the local proxy; the proxy maps requests to the Claude Agent SDK and your Claude Max session. Usage limits follow your Max subscription, not Anthropic API billing tiers.
