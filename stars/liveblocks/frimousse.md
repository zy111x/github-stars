## Installation

```bash
npm i frimousse
```

If you are using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), you can also install it as a pre-built component via the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://frimousse.liveblocks.io/r/emoji-picker
```

Learn more in the [shadcn/ui](#shadcnui) section.

## Usage

Import the `EmojiPicker` parts and create your own component by composing them.

```tsx
import { EmojiPicker } from "frimousse";

export function MyEmojiPicker() {
  return (
    <EmojiPicker.Root>
      <EmojiPicker.Search />
      <EmojiPicker.Viewport>
        <EmojiPicker.Loading>Loading…</EmojiPicker.Loading>
        <EmojiPicker.Empty>No emoji found.</EmojiPicker.Empty>
        <EmojiPicker.List />
      </EmojiPicker.Viewport>
    </EmojiPicker.Root>
  );
}
```

Apart from a few sizing and overflow defaults, the parts don’t have any styles out-of-the-box. Being composable, you can bring your own styles and apply them however you want: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), CSS-in-JS, vanilla CSS via inline styles, classes, or by targeting the `[frimousse-*]` attributes present on each part.

You might want to use it in a popover rather than on its own. Frimousse only provides the emoji picker itself so if you don’t have a popover component in your app yet, there are several libraries available: [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/popover), [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/react/components/popover), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/react/popover), and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Popover.html), to name a few.

### shadcn/ui

If you are using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), you can install a pre-built version which integrates with the existing shadcn/ui variables via the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://frimousse.liveblocks.io/r/emoji-picker
```

It can be composed and combined with other shadcn/ui components like [Popover](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/popover).

## Documentation

Find the full documentation and examples on [frimousse.liveblocks.io](https://frimousse.liveblocks.io).

## Compatibility

- React 18 and 19
- TypeScript 5.1 and above

## Miscellaneous

The name [“frimousse”](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frimousse) means “little face” in French, and it can also refer to smileys and emoticons.

The emoji picker component was originally created for the [Liveblocks Comments](https://liveblocks.io/comments) default components, within [`@liveblocks/react-ui`](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/packages/liveblocks-react-ui).

## Credits

The emoji data is based on [Emojibase](https://emojibase.dev/).

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature request, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/liveblocks/frimousse/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/liveblocks/frimousse/pulls).

The project is setup as a monorepo with the `frimousse` package at the root and [frimousse.liveblocks.io](https://frimousse.liveblocks.io) in the `site` directory.

### Development

Install dependencies and start development builds from the root.

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

The site can be used as a development playground since it’s built with the root package via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

```bash
npm run dev:site
```

### Tests

The package has 95%+ test coverage with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Some tests use Vitest’s [browser mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser-testing) with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), make sure to install the required browser first.

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Run the tests.

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Releases

Releases are triggered from [a GitHub action](.github/workflows/release.yml) via [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it), and continuous releases are automatically triggered for every commit in PRs via [pkg.pr.new](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/pkg.pr.new).
