# MCPHub: The Unified Hub for Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

English | [Français](README.fr.md) | [中文版](README.zh.md)

MCPHub makes it easy to manage and scale multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers by organizing them into flexible Streamable HTTP (SSE) endpoints—supporting access to all servers, individual servers, or logical server groups.

## 🌐 Live Demo & Docs

- **Documentation**: [docs.mcphub.app](https://docs.mcphub.app/)
- **Demo Environment**: [demo.mcphub.app](https://demo.mcphub.app/)

## 🚀 Features

- **Centralized Management** - Monitor and control all MCP servers from a unified dashboard
- **Flexible Routing** - Access all servers, specific groups, or individual servers via HTTP/SSE
- **Granular Group Visibility** - Control Tool, Prompt, and Resource visibility independently for each server inside a group
- **Smart Routing** - AI-powered tool discovery using vector semantic search ([Learn more](https://docs.mcphub.app/features/smart-routing))
- **MCP Apps Proxy** - Transparently forward interactive MCP Apps on single-server routes ([Learn more](https://docs.mcphub.app/features/mcp-apps))
- **Tool Result Compression** - Transparently reduce large text tool outputs before they reach clients
- **Hot-Swappable Config** - Add, remove, or update servers without downtime
- **OAuth 2.0 Support** - Both client and server modes for secure authentication ([Learn more](https://docs.mcphub.app/features/oauth))
- **Social Login** - Seamless GitHub and Google login support with Better Auth integration (requires Database Mode)
- **Database Mode** - Store configuration in PostgreSQL for production environments ([Learn more](https://docs.mcphub.app/configuration/database-configuration))
- **Docker-Ready** - Deploy instantly with containerized setup

## 🔧 Quick Start

### Configuration

Create a `mcp_settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "time": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "time-mcp"]
    },
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
    }
  }
}
```

📖 See [Configuration Guide](https://docs.mcphub.app/configuration/mcp-settings) for full options including OAuth, environment variables, and more.

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Run with custom config (recommended)
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./mcp_settings.json:/app/mcp_settings.json -v ./data:/app/data samanhappy/mcphub

# Or run with default settings (also mount ./data so credentials and state survive restarts)
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./data:/app/data samanhappy/mcphub
```

### Access Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3000` and log in with username `admin`. On first launch, if no `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable is set, a random password is generated and printed to the server logs. You can also pre-set the password:

```bash
# Docker: set admin password via environment variable
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password samanhappy/mcphub
```

> **Tip:** Change the admin password after first login for security.

> **Headless mode:** Set `DISABLE_WEB=true` to skip serving the bundled dashboard UI and run MCPHub with only the backend/API and MCP endpoints. This is useful when you want to manage servers directly from `mcp_settings.json`.

### Connect AI Clients

Connect AI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) via:

```
http://localhost:3000/mcp           # All servers
http://localhost:3000/mcp/{group}   # Specific group
http://localhost:3000/mcp/{server}  # Specific server
http://localhost:3000/mcp/$smart    # Smart routing
http://localhost:3000/mcp/$smart/{group}  # Smart routing within group
```

> **Security note**: MCP endpoints require authentication by default to prevent accidental exposure. To allow unauthenticated MCP access, disable **Enable Bearer Authentication** in the Keys section. **Skip Authentication** only affects dashboard login. Use only in trusted environments.

📖 See [API Reference](https://docs.mcphub.app/api-reference) for detailed endpoint documentation.

### Manage From the Terminal

The same `mcphub` binary doubles as a CLI for the running hub — no extra install needed.

```bash
mcphub login --url http://localhost:3000 --username admin
mcphub servers list
mcphub servers add fetch --type stdio --command uvx --arg mcp-server-fetch
mcphub tools list                              # discover what tools are available
mcphub tools get fetch_url                     # see required params + sample command
mcphub call fetch_url url=https://example.com --json
mcphub keys create --name ci --access-type all
```

It also speaks the public marketplace API (`mcphub discover`, `mcphub install ...`) so server lookup and one-command install work against any hub with discovery enabled.

📖 See [CLI Guide](https://docs.mcphub.app/features/cli) for every subcommand, profiles, and CI usage.

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samanhappy/mcphub.git
cd mcphub
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

> For Windows users, start backend and frontend separately: `pnpm backend:dev`, `pnpm frontend:dev`

📖 See [Development Guide](https://docs.mcphub.app/development) for detailed setup instructions.

## 🔍 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript (ESM)
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: file-based `mcp_settings.json` by default; PostgreSQL via TypeORM with pgvector for Smart Routing
- **Auth**: JWT + bcrypt for local accounts; bearer keys; built-in OAuth 2.0 server (`@node-oauth/oauth2-server`); optional Better Auth for GitHub/Google login
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol SDK
