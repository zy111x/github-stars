Mastra is an opinionated TypeScript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations and evals. You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

The main Mastra features are:

| Features                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| LLM Models                                                    | Mastra uses the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) for model routing, providing a unified interface to interact with any LLM provider including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. You can choose the specific model and provider, and decide whether to stream the response. |
| [Agents](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/overview)              | Agents are systems where the language model chooses a sequence of actions. In Mastra, agents provide LLM models with tools, workflows, and synced data. Agents can call your own functions or APIs of third-party integrations and access knowledge bases you build.                                   |
| [Tools](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/adding-tools)           | Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.                               |
| [Workflows](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview)        | Workflows are durable graph-based state machines. They have loops, branching, wait for human input, embed other workflows, do error handling, retries, parsing and so on. They can be built in code or with a visual editor. Each step in a workflow has built-in OpenTelemetry tracing.               |
| [RAG](https://mastra.ai/docs/rag/overview)                    | Retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) lets you construct a knowledge base for agents. RAG is an ETL pipeline with specific querying techniques, including chunking, embedding, and vector search.                                                                                                      |
| [Integrations](https://mastra.ai/docs/local-dev/integrations) | In Mastra, integrations are auto-generated, type-safe API clients for third-party services that can be used as tools for agents or steps in workflows.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Evals](https://mastra.ai/docs/08-running-evals)              | Evals are automated tests that evaluate LLM outputs using model-graded, rule-based, and statistical methods. Each eval returns a normalized score between 0-1 that can be logged and compared. Evals can be customized with your own prompts and scoring functions.                                    |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.0+)

## Get an LLM provider API key

If you don't have an API key for an LLM provider, you can get one from the following services:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)
- [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview)
- [Cerebras](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/introduction)

If you don't have an account with these providers, you can sign up and get an API key. Anthropic require a credit card to get an API key. Some OpenAI models and Gemini do not and have a generous free tier for its API.

## Create a new project

The easiest way to get started with Mastra is by using `create-mastra`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Mastra application, with everything set up for you.

```bash
npx create-mastra@latest
```

### Run the script

Finally, run `mastra dev` to open the Mastra playground.

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

If you're using Anthropic, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. If you're using Gemini, set the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`.
