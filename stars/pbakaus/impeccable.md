# Impeccable

The vocabulary you didn't know you needed. 1 skill, 18 commands, and curated anti-patterns for impeccable frontend design.

> **Quick start:** Visit [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style) to download ready-to-use bundles.

## Why Impeccable?

Anthropic created [frontend-design](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/frontend-design), a skill that guides Claude toward better UI design. Impeccable builds on that foundation with deeper expertise and more control.

Every LLM learned from the same generic templates. Without guidance, you get the same predictable mistakes: Inter font, purple gradients, cards nested in cards, gray text on colored backgrounds.

Impeccable fights that bias with:
- **An expanded skill** with 7 domain-specific reference files ([view source](source/skills/impeccable/))
- **18 steering commands** to audit, review, polish, distill, animate, and more
- **Curated anti-patterns** that explicitly tell the AI what NOT to do

## What's Included

### The Skill: impeccable

A comprehensive design skill with 7 domain-specific references ([view skill](source/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md)):

| Reference | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| [typography](source/skills/impeccable/reference/typography.md) | Type systems, font pairing, modular scales, OpenType |
| [color-and-contrast](source/skills/impeccable/reference/color-and-contrast.md) | OKLCH, tinted neutrals, dark mode, accessibility |
| [spatial-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/spatial-design.md) | Spacing systems, grids, visual hierarchy |
| [motion-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/motion-design.md) | Easing curves, staggering, reduced motion |
| [interaction-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/interaction-design.md) | Forms, focus states, loading patterns |
| [responsive-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/responsive-design.md) | Mobile-first, fluid design, container queries |
| [ux-writing](source/skills/impeccable/reference/ux-writing.md) | Button labels, error messages, empty states |

### 18 Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/impeccable teach` | One-time setup: gather design context, save to config |
| `/impeccable craft` | Full shape-then-build flow with visual iteration |
| `/impeccable extract` | Pull reusable components and tokens into the design system |
| `/audit` | Run technical quality checks (a11y, performance, responsive) |
| `/critique` | UX design review: hierarchy, clarity, emotional resonance |
| `/polish` | Final pass, design system alignment, and shipping readiness |
| `/distill` | Strip to essence |
| `/clarify` | Improve unclear UX copy |
| `/optimize` | Performance improvements |
| `/harden` | Error handling, onboarding, i18n, edge cases |
| `/animate` | Add purposeful motion |
| `/colorize` | Introduce strategic color |
| `/bolder` | Amplify boring designs |
| `/quieter` | Tone down overly bold designs |
| `/delight` | Add moments of joy |
| `/adapt` | Adapt for different devices |
| `/typeset` | Fix font choices, hierarchy, sizing |
| `/layout` | Fix layout, spacing, visual rhythm |
| `/overdrive` | Add technically extraordinary effects |

#### Usage Examples

**`/audit`** - Run quality checks, get a report (no edits)
```
/audit blog              # Audit blog hub + post pages
/audit dashboard         # Check dashboard components
/audit checkout flow     # Focus on checkout UX
```
*When to use:* Before making changes, to understand what needs fixing.

**`/normalize`** - Align with design system
```
/normalize blog          # Apply design tokens, fix spacing
/normalize buttons       # Standardize button styles
```
*When to use:* After audit, to fix inconsistencies.

**`/critique`** - UX design review
```
/critique landing page   # Review landing page UX
/critique onboarding     # Check onboarding flow
```
*When to use:* When you want design feedback, not technical fixes.

**`/polish`** - Final pass before shipping
```
/polish feature modal    # Clean up modal before release
/polish settings page    # Final review of settings UI
```
*When to use:* Last step before deploying to production.

**Combining commands:**
```
/audit /normalize /polish blog    # Full workflow: audit → fix → polish
/critique /harden checkout        # UX review + add error handling
```

### Anti-Patterns

The skill includes explicit guidance on what to avoid:

- Don't use overused fonts (Arial, Inter, system defaults)
- Don't use gray text on colored backgrounds
- Don't use pure black/gray (always tint)
- Don't wrap everything in cards or nest cards inside cards
- Don't use bounce/elastic easing (feels dated)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download from Website (Recommended)

Visit [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style), download the ZIP for your tool, and extract to your project.

### Option 2: Copy from Repository

**Cursor:**
```bash
cp -r dist/cursor/.cursor your-project/
```

> **Note:** Cursor skills require setup:
> 1. Switch to Nightly channel in Cursor Settings → Beta
> 2. Enable Agent Skills in Cursor Settings → Rules
>
> [Learn more about Cursor skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills)

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# Project-specific
cp -r dist/claude-code/.claude your-project/

# Or global (applies to all projects)
cp -r dist/claude-code/.claude/* ~/.claude/
```

**OpenCode:**
```bash
cp -r dist/opencode/.opencode your-project/
```

**Pi:**
```bash
cp -r dist/pi/.pi your-project/
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
cp -r dist/gemini/.gemini your-project/
```

> **Note:** Gemini CLI skills require setup:
> 1. Install preview version: `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli@preview`
> 2. Run `/settings` and enable "Skills"
> 3. Run `/skills list` to verify installation
>

# Or global (applies to all projects)
cp -r dist/rovo-dev/.rovodev/skills/* ~/.rovodev/skills/
```

## Usage

Once installed, use commands in your AI harness:

```
/audit           # Find issues
/normalize       # Fix inconsistencies
/polish          # Final cleanup
/distill         # Remove complexity
```

Most commands accept an optional argument to focus on a specific area:

```
/audit header
/polish checkout-form
```

**Note:** Codex CLI uses a different syntax: `/prompts:audit`, `/prompts:polish`, etc.

## CLI

Impeccable includes a standalone CLI for detecting anti-patterns without an AI harness:

```bash
npx impeccable detect src/                   # scan a directory
npx impeccable detect index.html             # scan an HTML file
npx impeccable detect https://example.com    # scan a URL (Puppeteer)
npx impeccable detect --fast --json .        # regex-only, JSON output
```

The detector catches 24 issues across AI slop (side-tab borders, purple gradients, bounce easing, dark glows) and general design quality (line length, cramped padding, small touch targets, skipped headings, and more).
