# Impeccable

The vocabulary you didn't know you needed. 1 skill, 23 commands, and curated anti-patterns for impeccable frontend design.

> **Quick start:** Visit [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style) to download ready-to-use bundles.

## Why Impeccable?

Anthropic created [frontend-design](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/frontend-design), a skill that guides Claude toward better UI design. Impeccable builds on that foundation with deeper expertise and more control.

Every LLM learned from the same generic templates. Without guidance, you get the same predictable mistakes: Inter font, purple gradients, cards nested in cards, gray text on colored backgrounds.

Impeccable fights that bias with:
- **An expanded skill** with 7 domain-specific reference files ([view source](source/skills/impeccable/))
- **23 commands** to audit, review, polish, distill, animate, and more
- **Curated anti-patterns** that explicitly tell the AI what NOT to do

## What's Included

### The Skill: impeccable

A comprehensive design skill with 7 domain-specific references ([view skill](source/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md)):

| Reference | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| [typography](source/skills/impeccable/reference/typography.md) | Type systems, font pairing, modular scales, OpenType |
| [color-and-contrast](source/skills/impeccable/reference/color-and-contrast.md) | OKLCH, tinted neutrals, dark mode, accessibility |
| [spatial-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/spatial-design.md) | Spacing systems, grids, visual hierarchy |
| [motion-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/motion-design.md) | Easing curves, staggering, reduced motion |
| [interaction-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/interaction-design.md) | Forms, focus states, loading patterns |
| [responsive-design](source/skills/impeccable/reference/responsive-design.md) | Mobile-first, fluid design, container queries |
| [ux-writing](source/skills/impeccable/reference/ux-writing.md) | Button labels, error messages, empty states |

### 23 Commands

All commands are accessed through `/impeccable`:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/impeccable craft` | Full shape-then-build flow with visual iteration |
| `/impeccable teach` | One-time setup: gather design context, write PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md |
| `/impeccable document` | Generate DESIGN.md from existing project code |
| `/impeccable extract` | Pull reusable components and tokens into the design system |
| `/impeccable shape` | Plan UX/UI before writing code |
| `/impeccable critique` | UX design review: hierarchy, clarity, emotional resonance |
| `/impeccable audit` | Run technical quality checks (a11y, performance, responsive) |
| `/impeccable polish` | Final pass, design system alignment, and shipping readiness |
| `/impeccable bolder` | Amplify boring designs |
| `/impeccable quieter` | Tone down overly bold designs |
| `/impeccable distill` | Strip to essence |
| `/impeccable harden` | Error handling, i18n, text overflow, edge cases |
| `/impeccable onboard` | First-run flows, empty states, activation paths |
| `/impeccable animate` | Add purposeful motion |
| `/impeccable colorize` | Introduce strategic color |
| `/impeccable typeset` | Fix font choices, hierarchy, sizing |
| `/impeccable layout` | Fix layout, spacing, visual rhythm |
| `/impeccable delight` | Add moments of joy |
| `/impeccable overdrive` | Add technically extraordinary effects |
| `/impeccable clarify` | Improve unclear UX copy |
| `/impeccable adapt` | Adapt for different devices |
| `/impeccable optimize` | Performance improvements |
| `/impeccable live` | Visual variant mode: iterate on elements in the browser |

Use `/impeccable pin <command>` to create standalone shortcuts (e.g., `pin audit` creates `/audit`).

#### Usage Examples

```
/impeccable audit blog           # Audit blog hub + post pages
/impeccable critique landing     # UX design review
/impeccable polish settings      # Final pass before shipping
/impeccable harden checkout      # Add error handling + edge cases
```

Or use `/impeccable` directly with a description:
```
/impeccable redo this hero section
```

### Anti-Patterns

The skill includes explicit guidance on what to avoid:

- Don't use overused fonts (Arial, Inter, system defaults)
- Don't use gray text on colored backgrounds
- Don't use pure black/gray (always tint)
- Don't wrap everything in cards or nest cards inside cards
- Don't use bounce/elastic easing (feels dated)

## Installation

### Option 1: Download from Website (Recommended)

Visit [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style), download the ZIP for your tool, and extract to your project.

### Option 2: Copy from Repository

**Cursor:**
```bash
cp -r dist/cursor/.cursor your-project/
```

> **Note:** Cursor skills require setup:
> 1. Switch to Nightly channel in Cursor Settings → Beta
> 2. Enable Agent Skills in Cursor Settings → Rules
>
> [Learn more about Cursor skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills)

**Claude Code:**
```bash
# Project-specific
cp -r dist/claude-code/.claude your-project/

# Or global (applies to all projects)
cp -r dist/claude-code/.claude/* ~/.claude/
```

**OpenCode:**
```bash
cp -r dist/opencode/.opencode your-project/
```

**Pi:**
```bash
cp -r dist/pi/.pi your-project/
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
cp -r dist/gemini/.gemini your-project/
```

> **Note:** Gemini CLI skills require setup:
> 1. Install preview version: `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli@preview`
> 2. Run `/settings` and enable "Skills"
> 3. Run `/skills list` to verify installation
>
> [Learn more about Gemini CLI skills](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/)

**Codex CLI:**
```bash
# Project-local
cp -r dist/agents/.agents your-project/

# Or user-wide
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r dist/agents/.agents/skills/* ~/.agents/skills/
```

**GitHub Copilot:**
```bash
cp -r dist/github/.github your-project/
```

**Trae:**

# Trae China (domestic version)
cp -r dist/trae/.trae-cn/skills/* ~/.trae-cn/skills/

# Trae International
cp -r dist/trae/.trae/skills/* ~/.trae/skills/
```

> **Note:** Trae has two versions with different config directories:
> - **Trae China**: `~/.trae-cn/skills/`
> - **Trae International**: `~/.trae/skills/`
>

```

## Usage

Once installed, use commands in your AI harness:

```
/audit           # Find issues
/normalize       # Fix inconsistencies
/polish          # Final cleanup
/distill         # Remove complexity
```

Most commands accept an optional argument to focus on a specific area:

```
/audit header
/polish checkout-form
```

**Note:** Codex uses skills here, not `/prompts:` commands. Open `/skills` or type `$impeccable`. Repo-local installs live in `.agents/skills/`; user-wide installs live in `~/.agents/skills/`. GitHub Copilot uses `.github/skills/`. Restart the tool if a newly installed skill does not appear.

## CLI

Impeccable includes a standalone CLI for detecting anti-patterns without an AI harness:

```bash
npx impeccable detect src/                   # scan a directory
npx impeccable detect index.html             # scan an HTML file
npx impeccable detect https://example.com    # scan a URL (Puppeteer)
npx impeccable detect --fast --json .        # regex-only, JSON output
```

The detector catches 24 issues across AI slop (side-tab borders, purple gradients, bounce easing, dark glows) and general design quality (line length, cramped padding, small touch targets, skipped headings, and more).
