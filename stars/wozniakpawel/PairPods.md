## About

PairPods is a macOS menubar app that lets you share audio between multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously. Whether you're watching a movie with a friend on a train or sharing your favorite music, PairPods makes it easy to create shared listening experiences.

## Features

- 🎧 Share audio between two or more Bluetooth devices
- 🎛️ Per-device toggles to choose which devices participate
- 🎵 Compatible with all macOS-supported Bluetooth audio devices
- 🔌 Simple plug-and-play interface
- ⚡️ Quick access from the menubar
- 🎚️ Adjust volume levels for each device separately
- 🔄 Auto-reconnect when devices disconnect
- ⏱️ Configurable auto-reconnect timeout (Off, 5 s, 10 s or 30 s)
- 🔊 See each device's sample rate to understand audio quality and mismatch
- 🔋 Battery level display when supported by the device
- 👑 Set any device as the master clock with one click
- 🖥️ Native macOS app built with SwiftUI
- 💯 Completely free and open source

## Requirements

- macOS 13.5 (Ventura) or later
- Both Apple and Intel silicon are supported
- Two or more compatible Bluetooth audio devices

## Installation

### Homebrew

To install PairPods with Homebrew, simply run:

```bash
brew install --cask pairpods
```

### Updates
Please note that PairPods uses Sparkle to check for and notify you of new updates automatically. Homebrew does not provide update notifications.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/wozniakpawel/PairPods/releases)
2. Double click on the .zip file to unzip it.
3. Move PairPods.app to your Applications folder
4. Launch PairPods from your Applications folder

## Usage

1. Connect two or more Bluetooth devices to your Mac
2. Click on the PairPods menubar icon
3. Use the checkboxes to select which devices to include
4. Toggle "Share Audio" to start sharing
5. Toggle again to stop sharing

## Building from Source

1. Prerequisites:
   - macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) or later
   - Xcode 16.0 or later

2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wozniakpawel/PairPods.git
```

3. Open PairPods.xcodeproj in Xcode

4. Build and run the project (⌘R)

## Known Limitations

- **Audio pitch shifting between devices with different sample rates**: When two Bluetooth devices have different native sample rates (e.g., 44,100 Hz vs 48,000 Hz), audio may sound pitch-shifted or warped on one device. PairPods now shows each device's sample rate in the menu so you can identify mismatches. If you experience pitch shifting, try using two devices of the same model or brand, as they are more likely to share the same native sample rate. You can also tap the crown icon to set a device as the master clock.
