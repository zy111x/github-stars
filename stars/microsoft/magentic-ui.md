**MagenticLite** is the next generation of Magentic-UI — an agentic application from **Microsoft AI Frontiers**, redesigned to do more with less. It pairs an on-device-friendly orchestrator model ([MagenticBrain](https://aka.ms/MagenticBrain-foundry)) with a specialized browser-use model ([Fara](https://aka.ms/fara-foundry)) so you can automate real work without depending on frontier-scale compute.

- **Built for small models, efficient by design.** Strong agentic performance without heavy compute — no frontier-scale models required.
- **Works across the browser and your local file system.** Web research, form filling, file management — in one workflow.
- **Keeps you in the loop and in control.** Steer, approve, or take over at any point. MagenticLite stops and checks in before taking critical actions.
- **Safe by design.** Browser sessions run inside a lightweight VM sandbox ([Quicksand](https://microsoft.github.io/quicksand/)) so the agent can't reach the rest of your machine without your say-so.

## Quick start

These steps get you running on macOS or Windows (WSL). Need more detail or a different platform? See the [Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md).

### 1. Install MagenticLite

```bash
# Create a project directory
mkdir magentic-lite && cd magentic-lite

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv --python=3.12 --seed .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the latest 0.2.x release from PyPI
uv pip install "magentic_ui>=0.2.0"
```

### 2. Run

```bash
magentic-ui --port 8081
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8081/> and follow the in-app onboarding to connect a model endpoint. If you don't have one yet, see the [Model Hosting Guide](./docs/model-hosting-guide.md).

> **Looking for the previous Magentic-UI 0.1 release** (optimized to run with frontier models)? It lives on the [`magentic-ui-0.1`](https://github.com/microsoft/magentic-ui/tree/magentic-ui-0.1) branch.
