Open and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files in a browser tab. There is no
server: the OnlyOffice engine and its WASM converter run on the visitor's own
device, so documents are never uploaded, and no account is involved.

**Live site: [edit.chaxus.com](https://edit.chaxus.com/)**

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Nothing is uploaded** — every conversion, edit and export happens in the tab
- 📝 **Real editing, not preview** — DOCX, XLSX, PPTX and CSV, plus ODF, RTF, TXT and the legacy binary formats; PDFs open and can be annotated
- 💾 **Saves into your own file** — pick it once, every save after writes back to it (Chromium; elsewhere it downloads as before)
- 🕓 **Nothing is lost if you close the tab** — edits autosave into your own browser, kept for 7 days, deletable any time ([details](#-your-data-stays-on-your-device))
- 📴 **Works offline** — installable as a PWA; after the first visit no network is needed
- 🌍 **Multi-language** — 7 languages end to end (English, 中文, 日本語, Deutsch, Español, 한국어, Português): the pages, the app UI and the editor all follow the one you pick; the editor itself ships 45
- 🧩 **Embeddable** — full postMessage API for iframe integration
- 🤖 **Agent-ready** — exposes WebMCP tools so a browser AI agent can open, convert and read documents
- 🚀 **Deploy anywhere** — a static build; a directory of files behind any web server

(UTF-8, GB18030 and Latin-1 are sniffed on open).

## 🔐 Your data stays on your device

Documents are never sent anywhere. Where the browser allows it, saving writes
straight back into the file you picked, so the document lives in your own file
system and not in a downloads folder. Two things are kept in the browser
itself, and both are yours to remove:

- **Copies of what you edited.** While you work, the editor saves the document
  into this browser (IndexedDB) so a refresh, a closed tab or a crash does not
  cost you the work. Reopening the editor offers it back. These copies exist so
  you can pick up where you left off — they are not a backup, so keep exporting
  anything you want to keep.
- **Seven days, then gone.** Each document is deleted automatically seven days
  after you last edited or opened it, whether or not you come back.

[`/history`](https://edit.chaxus.com/history) lists what is stored, with a
delete on every row, a delete-all, and a switch to turn autosave off entirely.
Deleting there takes effect immediately. On a shared machine, that is the page
to visit.

---

## 🧩 Embedding via iframe

Embed the editor and drive it over postMessage. The usual split is: your system
handles auth and storage, the iframe handles editing.

```html
<iframe
  id="documentEditor"
  src="https://your-deployment/editor?embed=1"
  style="width: 100%; height: 720px; border: 0"
></iframe>
```

```js
// Open a document
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(
  { id: '1', type: 'document:open-url', payload: { url: 'https://example.com/doc.xlsx' } },
  'https://your-deployment',
);

// Listen for the result
window.addEventListener('message', (e) => {
  if (e.data?.type === 'document:opened') console.log('Ready to edit');
  if (e.data?.type === 'document:saved') uploadFile(e.data.payload.file);
});
```

Embedded editors keep no local history — the document belongs to the host page.

→ **[Full API reference](docs/embed-api.md)** — every message type, the origin
allowlist, read-only mode and the save flow.

Also available as a component: this project powers the document preview in
[@ranui/preview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ranui/preview)
([docs](https://chaxus.github.io/ran/src/ranui/preview/)).

---

## 🤖 Browser AI agents (WebMCP)

Where the browser supports it, the page registers tools an in-browser agent can
call directly instead of driving the UI: `open_document_url`,
`open_document_buffer`, `create_document`, `save_document`, `get_document_text`,
`set_readonly`, `get_document_state`. Documents still never leave the device —
the browser fetches and converts them itself. Where the API is absent, this is
a no-op.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

A static build — no runtime, no database.

```bash
pnpm build   # outputs to dist/
```

### Static hosting (Cloudflare Pages, Nginx, Vercel, Netlify…)

Upload `dist/`. `public/_headers` carries the caching contract the site expects
(hashed assets immutable, service worker never cached); hosts that ignore it
still work, they just revalidate more.

For Nginx, serve `index.html` as the fallback for unknown routes:

```nginx
location / {
  root /var/www/document;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/pages-build-site.yml` builds and deploys on push to `main`.
Enable Pages in the repository settings with **GitHub Actions** as the source.

### Docker

```bash
# Basic
docker run -d --name document -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/ranuts/document:latest

# With HTTPS and basic auth
docker run -d --name document -p 443:443 \
  -v /path/to/certs:/ssl \
  -e SERVER_BASIC_AUTH='user:$2y$...' \
  -e SERVER_HTTP2_TLS=true \
  -e SERVER_HTTP2_TLS_CERT=/ssl/cert.pem \
  -e SERVER_HTTP2_TLS_KEY=/ssl/key.pem \
  ghcr.io/ranuts/document:latest
```

`SERVER_BASIC_AUTH` takes a BCrypt hash; double the `$` characters for shell
escaping. Caching for the image is configured in `sws.toml`.

---

## 🔤 Fonts

The vendored OnlyOffice build ships its font library in `public/fonts/`, indexed
by `public/sdkjs/common/AllFonts.js`. Fonts are fetched on demand — a document
only pulls the ones it actually uses.

→ **[Font management guide](docs/fonts.md)** — the indexed catalog's wire
format, the registries, and adding fonts with `bin/font-catalog.mjs`.

---

## 🛠 Development

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run dev            # dev server
pnpm run build          # production build (bin/build.sh)
pnpm run lint           # oxlint + tsc + docker config
pnpm run test           # unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm run test:e2e       # end-to-end tests (Playwright, real editor + real WASM)
```

The end-to-end suite drives the real editor and the real converter rather than
mocks, including document round trips, the embed protocol and the recovery
flow. `docs/explorations/` records why each non-obvious piece is the way it is —
worth a look before changing the editor integration.

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. `main` is protected: work on a branch and
open a PR, which runs lint, unit tests and three end-to-end suites (dev server,
Cloudflare Pages semantics, and the production Docker image).
