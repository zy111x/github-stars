## What is iii

You start building a backend and immediately need six different tools: an API framework, a task queue, a cron scheduler, pub/sub, a state store, and an observability pipeline. Each has its own config, its own deployment, its own failure modes. A simple "process this, then notify that" workflow touches three services before you write any business logic.

iii replaces all of that with a single engine and three primitives: **Function**, **Trigger**, and **Worker**.

A Function is anything that does work. A Trigger is what causes it to run - an HTTP request, a cron schedule, a queue message, a state change. A Worker connects your functions to the engine. You write the function, declare what triggers it, connect a worker, and the engine handles routing, retries, and observability.

One config file. One process. Everything discoverable. Think of it the way React gave frontend a single model for UI - iii gives your backend a single model for execution.

These primitives result in an execution model and system traits that make iii unreasonably good at creating backend software:

**Execution model** — Durable orchestration across workers and triggers. Interoperable execution across languages as if it were one runtime. Simple primitives that collapse distributed backend design into a paradigm humans and agents can reason about.

**Live system traits** — Functions and triggers exposed by one worker become visible and usable across the system in real time (live discovery). Add new workers and capabilities to a live iii system without redesigning the architecture (live extensibility). Observe operations, traces, and system behavior across the entire connected stack in real time (live observability).

## Three Concepts

| Concept      | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function** | A unit of work. It receives input and optionally returns output. It can exist anywhere: locally, in the cloud, on serverless, or as a third-party HTTP endpoint.                                                |
| **Trigger**  | What causes a Function to run - explicitly from code, or automatically from an event source. Examples: HTTP route, cron schedule, queue topic, state change, stream event.                                      |
| **Worker**   | The runtime that connects your functions and triggers to the engine. Workers register and deregister themselves without configuration. Once connected, their functions are available across the entire backend. |

## Quick Start

Get started with iii by following the [Quickstart guide](https://iii.dev/docs/quickstart).

## SDKs

| Language | Package                                            | Install               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Node.js  | [`iii-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iii-sdk) | `npm install iii-sdk` |
| Python   | [`iii-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/iii-sdk/)     | `pip install iii-sdk` |
| Rust     | [`iii-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/iii-sdk)      | Add to `Cargo.toml`   |

## Agent Skills

Give your AI coding agent full context on iii:

```bash
npx skillkit add iii-hq/iii/skills
```

Skills covering every iii primitive — HTTP endpoints, queues, cron, state, streams, custom triggers, and more. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, and [30+ other agents](https://agentskills.io). See [skills/](skills/) for the full list.

## Console

The [iii-console](console/) is a developer and operations dashboard for inspecting functions, triggers, traces, and real-time state. See the [Console docs](https://iii.dev/docs/console) for setup and usage.
