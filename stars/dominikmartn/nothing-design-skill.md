# Nothing Design Skill

A design system skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) inspired by Nothing's visual language. Monochrome, typographic, industrial.

I kept describing the same design rules to Claude over and over — Swiss typography, OLED blacks, segmented progress bars, dot-matrix motifs. So I packaged it into a reusable skill.

## What you get

Tell Claude `/nothing-design` or say "Nothing style" and it generates UI following these principles:

- Three-layer visual hierarchy (display, body, metadata — that's it)
- Space Grotesk + Space Mono + Doto font stack
- Full dark and light mode token system
- Segmented progress bars, mechanical toggles, instrument-style widgets
- Output as HTML/CSS, SwiftUI, or React/Tailwind

## Install

Copy the `nothing-design` folder into your Claude Code skills directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dominikmartn/nothing-design-skill.git
cp -r nothing-design-skill/nothing-design ~/.claude/skills/
```

That's it. Next time you start Claude Code, the skill is available.
