Let's get you up and running with the stable version of Bolt.DIY!

## Quick Installation

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy?label=Download%20Bolt&sort=semver)](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy/releases/latest) ← Click here to go to the latest release version!

- Download the binary for your platform (available for Windows, macOS, and Linux)
- **Note**: For macOS, if you get the error "This app is damaged", run:
  ```bash
  xattr -cr /path/to/Bolt.app
  ```

## Manual installation


### Option 1: Node.js

Node.js is required to run the application.

1. Visit the [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version for your operating system
3. Run the installer, accepting the default settings
4. Verify Node.js is properly installed:
   - **For Windows Users**:
     1. Press `Windows + R`
     2. Type "sysdm.cpl" and press Enter
     3. Go to "Advanced" tab → "Environment Variables"
     4. Check if `Node.js` appears in the "Path" variable
   - **For Mac/Linux Users**:
     1. Open Terminal
     2. Type this command:
        ```bash
        echo $PATH
        ```
     3. Look for `/usr/local/bin` in the output

## Running the Application

You have two options for running Bolt.DIY: directly on your machine or using Docker.

### Option 1: Direct Installation (Recommended for Beginners)

1. **Install Package Manager (pnpm)**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   
### Option 2: Using Docker

This option requires Docker and is great when you want an isolated environment or to mirror the production image.

#### Additional Prerequisite

- Install Docker: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

#### Steps

1. **Prepare Environment Variables**

   Copy the provided examples and add your provider keys:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   The runtime scripts inside the container source `.env` and `.env.local`, so keep any API keys you need in one of those files.

2. **Build an Image**

   ```bash
   # Development image (bind-mounts your local source when run)
   pnpm run dockerbuild
   # ≈ docker build -t bolt-ai:development -t bolt-ai:latest --target development .

   # Production image (self-contained build artifacts)
   pnpm run dockerbuild:prod
   # ≈ docker build -t bolt-ai:production -t bolt-ai:latest --target bolt-ai-production .
   ```

3. **Run the Container**

   ```bash
   # Development workflow with hot reload
   docker compose --profile development up

   # Production-style container using composed services
   docker compose --profile production up

   # One-off production container (exposes the app on port 5173)
   docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:latest
   ```

   When the container starts it runs `pnpm run dockerstart`, which in turn executes `bindings.sh` to pass Cloudflare bindings through Wrangler. You can override this command in `docker-compose.yaml` if you need a different startup routine.

### Option 3: Desktop Application (Electron)

For users who prefer a native desktop experience, bolt.diy is also available as an Electron desktop application:

1. **Download the Desktop App**:
   - Visit the [latest release](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy/releases/latest)
   - Download the appropriate binary for your operating system
   - For macOS: Extract and run the `.dmg` file
   - For Windows: Run the `.exe` installer
   - For Linux: Extract and run the AppImage or install the `.deb` package

2. **Alternative**: Build from Source:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install

   # Build the Electron app
   pnpm electron:build:dist  # For all platforms
   # OR platform-specific:
   pnpm electron:build:mac   # macOS
   pnpm electron:build:win   # Windows
   pnpm electron:build:linux # Linux
   ```

The desktop app provides the same full functionality as the web version with additional native features.

## Setup Using Git (For Developers only)

This method is recommended for developers who want to:

- Contribute to the project
- Stay updated with the latest changes
- Switch between different versions
- Create custom modifications

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone -b stable https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd bolt.diy
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash

   ```

5. **(OPTIONAL)** Switch to the Main Branch if you want to use pre-release/testbranch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev
   ```
  Hint: Be aware that this can have beta-features and more likely got bugs than the stable release

>**Open the WebUI to test (Default: http://localhost:5173)**
>   - Beginners: 
>     - Try to use a sophisticated Provider/Model like Anthropic with Claude Sonnet 3.x Models to get best results
>     - Explanation: The System Prompt currently implemented in bolt.diy cant cover the best performance for all providers and models out there. So it works better with some models, then other, even if the models itself are perfect for >programming
>     - Future: Planned is a Plugin/Extentions-Library so there can be different System Prompts for different Models, which will help to get better results

#### Staying Updated

To get the latest changes from the repository:

1. **Save Your Local Changes** (if any):

   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
