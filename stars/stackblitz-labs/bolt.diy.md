bolt.diy (Previously oTToDev)
=============================

Welcome to bolt.diy, the official open source version of Bolt.new (previously known as oTToDev and bolt.new ANY LLM), which allows you to choose the LLM that you use for each prompt! Currently, you can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, LMStudio, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, or Groq models - and it is easily extended to use any other model supported by the Vercel AI SDK! See the instructions below for running this locally and extending it to include more models.

Check the bolt.diy Docs for more information.

We have also launched an experimental agent called the "bolt.diy Expert" that can answer common questions about bolt.diy. Find it here on the oTTomator Live Agent Studio.

bolt.diy was originally started by Cole Medin but has quickly grown into a massive community effort to build the BEST open source AI coding assistant!

Setup
-----

If you're new to installing software from GitHub, don't worry! If you encounter any issues, feel free to submit an "issue" using the provided links or improve this documentation by forking the repository, editing the instructions, and submitting a pull request. The following instruction will help you get the stable branch up and running on your local machine in no time.

Let's get you up and running with the stable version of Bolt.DIY!

Quick Download
--------------

← Click here to go the the latest release version!

-   Next **click source.zip**

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you'll need to install two important pieces of software:

### Install Node.js

Node.js is required to run the application.

1.  Visit the Node.js Download Page
2.  Download the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version for your operating system
3.  Run the installer, accepting the default settings
4.  Verify Node.js is properly installed:
    -   **For Windows Users**:
        1.  Press `Windows + R`
        2.  Type "sysdm.cpl" and press Enter
        3.  Go to "Advanced" tab → "Environment Variables"
        4.  Check if `Node.js` appears in the "Path" variable
    -   **For Mac/Linux Users**:
        1.  Open Terminal
        2.  Type this command:
            
            echo $PATH
            
        3.  Look for `/usr/local/bin` in the output

Running the Application
-----------------------

You have two options for running Bolt.DIY: directly on your machine or using Docker.

### Option 1: Direct Installation (Recommended for Beginners)

1.  **Install Package Manager (pnpm)**:
    
    npm install -g pnpm
    
2.  **Install Project Dependencies**:
    
    pnpm install
    
3.  **Start the Application**:
    
    pnpm run dev
    
    **Important Note**: If you're using Google Chrome, you'll need Chrome Canary for local development. Download it here
    

### Option 2: Using Docker

This option requires some familiarity with Docker but provides a more isolated environment.

#### Additional Prerequisite

-   Install Docker: Download Docker

#### Steps:

1.  **Build the Docker Image**:
    
    # Using npm script:
    npm run dockerbuild
    
    # OR using direct Docker command:
    docker build . --target bolt-ai-development
    
2.  **Run the Container**:
    
    docker-compose --profile development up
    

Configuring API Keys and Providers
----------------------------------

### Adding Your API Keys

Setting up your API keys in Bolt.DIY is straightforward:

1.  Open the home page (main interface)
2.  Select your desired provider from the dropdown menu
3.  Click the pencil (edit) icon
4.  Enter your API key in the secure input field

### Configuring Custom Base URLs

For providers that support custom base URLs (such as Ollama or LM Studio), follow these steps:

1.  Click the settings icon in the sidebar to open the settings menu
    
2.  Navigate to the "Providers" tab
    
3.  Search for your provider using the search bar
    
4.  Enter your custom base URL in the designated field
    

> **Note**: Custom base URLs are particularly useful when running local instances of AI models or using custom API endpoints.

### Supported Providers

-   Ollama
-   LM Studio
-   OpenAILike

#### Troubleshooting Git Setup

If you encounter issues:

1.  **Clean Installation**:
    
    # Remove node modules and lock files
    rm -rf node\_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
    
    # Clear pnpm cache
    pnpm store prune
    
    # Reinstall dependencies
    pnpm install
    
2.  **Reset Local Changes**:
