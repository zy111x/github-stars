This repository contains both the frontend and the backend of Checkmate, an open-source, self-hosted monitoring tool for tracking server hardware, uptime, response times, and incidents in real-time with beautiful visualizations. Checkmate regularly checks whether a server/website is accessible and performs optimally, providing real-time alerts and reports on the monitored services' availability, downtime, and response time.

Checkmate also has an agent, called [Capture](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture), to retrieve data from remote servers. While Capture is not required to run Checkmate, it provides additional insights about your servers' CPU, RAM, disk, and temperature status. Capture can run on Linux, Windows, Mac, Raspberry Pi, or any device that can run Go.

Checkmate has been stress-tested with 1000+ active monitors without any particular issues or performance bottlenecks.

## Demo

You can see the latest build of [Checkmate](https://demo.checkmate.so/) in action. 

The username is demouser@demo.com and the password is Demouser1! (just a note that we update the demo server from time to time, so if it doesn't work for you, please ping us on the Discussions channel).

## User's guide

Usage instructions can be found [here](https://checkmate.so/docs). 

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed

## Installation

See installation instructions in [Checkmate documentation portal](https://checkmate.so/docs). 

Alternatively, you can also use [Coolify](https://coolify.io/), [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/checkmate), [K8s](./charts/helm/checkmate/INSTALLATION.md), [Sive Host](https://sive.host) (South Africa), [Cloudzy](https://cloudzy.com/marketplace/checkmate) or [Pikapods](https://www.pikapods.com/) to quickly spin off a Checkmate instance. If you would like to monitor your server infrastructure, you'll need [Capture agent](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/capture). Capture repository also contains the installation instructions.

### Using a Custom CA

If you need to monitor internal HTTPS endpoints with certificates from private Certificate Authorities (like Smallstep), see our [Custom CA Trust Guide](./docs/custom-ca-trust.md) for Docker configuration options.

For more documentation, see the [docs directory](./docs/).

## Performance

Thanks to extensive optimizations, Checkmate operates with an exceptionally small memory footprint, requiring minimal memory and CPU resources. Here’s the memory usage of a Node.js instance running on a server that monitors 323 servers every minute:

You can see the memory footprint of MongoDB and Redis on the same server (398Mb and 15Mb) for the same amount of servers:

## Monitor Lifecycle

1. A monitor executes a check (HTTP / ping / port / hardware via Capture agent)
2. The result is stored (success/failure + response time)
3. Recent check results are evaluated against the monitor's configured status change threshold
4. If the monitor's status change threshold is met and the current status is not equal to the previous status, the monitor's state changes (e.g. `initializing`, `up`, `down`, `breached`)
5. Upon a state change: an incident is either created or resolved, depending on the monitor's current status
6. Notifications are triggered based on configuration
