# Cloudflare Workers SaaS Template

[![.github/workflows/deploy.yml](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

# [Github Repo](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template)

This is a SaaS template for Cloudflare Workers. It uses Vinext on Vite to run a Next.js App Router application directly on Cloudflare Workers.

## What is Vinext?

[Vinext](https://vinext.io/) is Cloudflare's experimental implementation of the public Next.js API surface on top of Vite. The goal is to let a Next.js app keep familiar App Router patterns, React Server Components, route handlers, and `next/*` imports while using Vite as the build and dev toolchain instead of the standard Next.js compiler pipeline.

For this template, Vinext is the runtime and deployment path for Cloudflare Workers. `pnpm dev` starts the Vinext development server, `pnpm build` produces the Vinext/Vite production output, and `pnpm deploy` uses `vinext deploy` to build and deploy the Worker. Vinext has first-class Cloudflare Workers support, including access to bindings such as D1, KV, R2, Images, Durable Objects, and AI through `cloudflare:workers`.

Vinext is not a fork of Next.js and is not affiliated with Vercel. It is still experimental, so framework-sensitive changes should be verified with `pnpm run check:vinext`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm run build`.

# Running it locally

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpx wrangler login` - Login to your Cloudflare account to use Cloudflare bindings while testing locally.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.
4. `pnpm db:migrate:dev` - Creates a local SQLite database and applies migrations
5. `pnpm db:seed` - Seeds the database with test data
6. `pnpm dev` - Starts the Vinext development server
7. Go to http://localhost:3000/sign-in and login with the test user credentials: test@test.com / password
8. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin to manage users and the CMS.

## End-to-end tests

E2E tests use Vitest with Playwright-driven Chromium pages and run against the production-style local Worker preview.

After cloning the project, install the Playwright Chromium browser once on your machine:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

This browser binary is not downloaded automatically by `pnpm install`. It is kept outside the repo in Playwright's local browser cache, so you normally only need to run the install command after a fresh machine setup, a new Playwright version, or a cleared Playwright cache.

Run the E2E suite with:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

The E2E runner stores its temporary files under `tmp/e2e`, creates a fresh local Wrangler/D1 state under `tmp/e2e/wrangler-state`, applies all D1 migrations, runs `src/db/seed.sql`, builds the app, starts Wrangler preview on that isolated state, then runs the browser tests against the preview Worker. If the existing `dist` output matches the current build input fingerprint, the runner reuses that fresh Vinext build instead of rebuilding. The build and D1 setup run in parallel, and Vitest runs test files in parallel with isolated Playwright browser contexts. This keeps E2E data separate from your normal local `.wrangler` development state.

VS Code Vitest Explorer is configured through `.vscode/settings.json` to use `vitest.e2e.config.ts`. Running an individual E2E test from the editor uses Vitest global setup to create the same isolated Wrangler/D1 state and preview Worker before the selected test starts.

In CI, install Chromium before running the suite:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium
pnpm run test:e2e
```

## Useful commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Vinext development server |
| `pnpm build` | Build the app with Vinext and Vite |
| `pnpm start` | Start the local Vinext production server |
| `pnpm preview` | Build, then preview the Worker locally with Wrangler |
| `pnpm run test:unit` | Run co-located Vitest unit tests |
| `pnpm run test:integration` | Run Cloudflare Workers Vitest integration tests with local D1/KV/Queue bindings |
| `pnpm run test:e2e` | Run Playwright-driven E2E tests against a clean local Wrangler/D1 preview |
| `pnpm deploy` | Build and deploy with `vinext deploy` |
| `pnpm deploy:dryrun` | Build and run a Wrangler deploy dry run into `worker-dist` |
| `pnpm check:vinext` | Run the Vinext compatibility checker |
| `pnpm run lint` | Run Oxlint |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript without emitting files |
| `pnpm run cf-typegen` | Regenerate Cloudflare Worker types |

## Changes to wrangler.jsonc

After making a change to `wrangler.jsonc`, run `pnpm run cf-typegen` to regenerate `worker-configuration.d.ts`.

Cloudflare bindings are defined in `wrangler.jsonc` and exposed to server code through `cloudflare:workers` or the local helper in `src/utils/cloudflare-context.ts`. The custom Worker entry lives in `worker-entrypoint.ts` and is configured as the `main` entry in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Things to change and customize before deploying to production

1. Go to `src/constants.ts` and update it with your project details
2. Update the `name` field in `package.json` to your project name so generated metrics and package metadata identify the reused template correctly
3. Update `AGENTS.md` with your project specification so that AI coding agents can give you better suggestions
4. Update the footer in `src/components/footer.tsx` with your project details and links
5. Optional: Update the color palette in `src/app/globals.css`
6. Update the metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx` with your project details
7. Update `cms.config.ts` if necessary

## Production deployment

The source of truth for preparing and deploying this template to production is the repo-local AI agent skill at `.agents/skills/prepare-cloudflare-production-deployment/SKILL.md`.

That skill covers Cloudflare resource provisioning with [Cloudflare MCP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/mcp-servers-for-cloudflare/), GitHub Actions secrets and variables with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), `wrangler.jsonc` binding updates, Worker secrets, Turnstile, Email Sending, and deployment verification.
