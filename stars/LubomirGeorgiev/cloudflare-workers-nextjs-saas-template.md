# Cloudflare Workers SaaS Template

[![.github/workflows/deploy.yml](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

# [Live Demo](https://nextjs-saas-template.lubomirgeorgiev.com/sign-up)
# [Github Repo](https://github.com/LubomirGeorgiev/cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template)

This is a SaaS template for Cloudflare Workers. It uses Vinext on Vite to run a Next.js App Router application directly on Cloudflare Workers.

## What is Vinext?

[Vinext](https://vinext.io/) is Cloudflare's experimental implementation of the public Next.js API surface on top of Vite. The goal is to let a Next.js app keep familiar App Router patterns, React Server Components, route handlers, and `next/*` imports while using Vite as the build and dev toolchain instead of the standard Next.js compiler pipeline.

For this template, Vinext is the runtime and deployment path for Cloudflare Workers. `pnpm dev` starts the Vinext development server, `pnpm build` produces the Vinext/Vite production output, and `pnpm deploy` uses `vinext deploy` to build and deploy the Worker. Vinext has first-class Cloudflare Workers support, including access to bindings such as D1, KV, R2, Images, Durable Objects, and AI through `cloudflare:workers`.

Vinext is not a fork of Next.js and is not affiliated with Vercel. It is still experimental, so framework-sensitive changes should be verified with `pnpm run check:vinext`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm run build`.

# Running it locally

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpx wrangler login` - Login to your Cloudflare account to use Cloudflare bindings while testing locally.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.
4. `pnpm db:migrate:dev` - Creates a local SQLite database and applies migrations
5. `pnpm db:seed` - Seeds the database with test data
6. `pnpm dev` - Starts the Vinext development server
7. Go to http://localhost:3000/sign-in and login with the test user credentials: test@test.com / password
8. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin to manage users and the CMS.

## Useful commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Vinext development server |
| `pnpm build` | Build the app with Vinext and Vite |
| `pnpm start` | Start the local Vinext production server |
| `pnpm preview` | Build, then preview the Worker locally with Wrangler |
| `pnpm deploy` | Build and deploy with `vinext deploy` |
| `pnpm deploy:dryrun` | Build and run a Wrangler deploy dry run into `worker-dist` |
| `pnpm check:vinext` | Run the Vinext compatibility checker |
| `pnpm run lint` | Run Oxlint |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript without emitting files |
| `pnpm run cf-typegen` | Regenerate Cloudflare Worker types |

## Changes to wrangler.jsonc

After making a change to `wrangler.jsonc`, run `pnpm run cf-typegen` to regenerate `worker-configuration.d.ts`.

Cloudflare bindings are defined in `wrangler.jsonc` and exposed to server code through `cloudflare:workers` or the local helper in `src/utils/cloudflare-context.ts`. The custom Worker entry lives in `worker-entrypoint.ts` and is configured as the `main` entry in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Things to change and customize before deploying to production
1. Go to `src/constants.ts` and update it with your project details
2. Update the `name` field in `package.json` to your project name so generated metrics and package metadata identify the reused template correctly
3. Update `AGENTS.md` with your project specification so that Cursor AI can give you better suggestions
4. Update the footer in `src/components/footer.tsx` with your project details and links
5. Optional: Update the color palette in `src/app/globals.css`
6. Update the metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx` with your project details
7. Update `cms.config.ts` if necessary

## Deploying to Cloudflare with Github Actions

1. Create D1, KV, and R2 resources, and make sure Cloudflare Images is enabled for your account.
2. Onboard your sending domain in Cloudflare Email Service, then update `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`, `EMAIL_REPLY_TO`, and the `send_email.allowed_sender_addresses` entry in `wrangler.jsonc`. The Worker uses the `EMAIL` Email Service binding to send transactional email.
3. Create a Turnstile catcha in your Cloudflare account, and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` as a Github Actions variable.
4. Set `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` as a secret in your Cloudflare Worker.
5. Update the `wrangler.jsonc` file with the new database, KV namespace, R2 bucket, env variables, Images binding, email binding, and account id. Search for "cloudflare-workers-nextjs-saas-template" recursively in the whole repository and change that to the name of your project.
6. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens and click on "Use template" next to "Edit Cloudflare Workers". On the next, page add the following permissions in addition to the ones from the template:
    - Account:AI Gateway:Edit
    - Account:Workers AI:Edit
    - Account:Workers AI:Read
    - Account:Queues:Edit
    - Account:Vectorize:Edit
    - Account:D1:Edit
    - Account:Cloudflare Images:Edit
    - Account:Workers KV Storage:Edit
    - Account:Email Sending:Edit
    - Zone:Cache Purge:Purge
7. Add the API token to the Github repository secrets as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
8. Add the Cloudflare account id to the Github repository variables as `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
9. Optional: If you want clear the CDN cache on deploy, add `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` to the Github repository variables for the zone id of your domain. This is the zone id of your domain, not the account id.
10. Push to the main branch. The workflow installs with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, runs lint and typecheck, deploys with `pnpm run deploy`, applies D1 migrations, optionally purges the CDN cache, and records deploy size metrics in `metrics/deploy-size-history.jsonl`.
