# MCP Proxy Server

An MCP proxy server that aggregates and serves multiple MCP resource servers through a single HTTP server.

## Features

- **Proxy Multiple MCP Clients**: Connects to multiple MCP resource servers and aggregates their tools and capabilities.
- **SSE / HTTP Streaming MCPSupport**: Provides an SSE (Server-Sent Events) or HTTP streaming interface for real-time updates from MCP clients.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports multiple client types (`stdio`, `sse` or `streamable-http`) with customizable settings.

## Installation

### Build from Source

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBXark/mcp-proxy.git
cd mcp-proxy
make build
./build/mcp-proxy --config path/to/config.json
```

### Install by go

```bash
# Install the latest version of mcp-proxy
go install github.com/TBXark/mcp-proxy@latest
# Or install stable version
go install github.com/TBXark/mcp-proxy
````

### Docker

> The Docker image supports two MCP calling methods by default: `npx` and `uvx`.

```bash
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/config.json:/config/config.json ghcr.io/tbxark/mcp-proxy:latest
# or 
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 ghcr.io/tbxark/mcp-proxy:latest --config https://example.com/path/to/config.json
```

## Configuration

The server is configured using a JSON file. Below is an example configuration:

> This is the format for the new version's configuration. The old version's configuration will be automatically converted to the new format's configuration when it is loaded.
> You can use [`https://tbxark.github.io/mcp-proxy`](https://tbxark.github.io/mcp-proxy) to convert the configuration of `mcp-proxy` into the configuration that `Claude` can use.

```jsonc
{
  "mcpProxy": {
    "baseURL": "https://mcp.example.com",
    "addr": ":9090",
    "name": "MCP Proxy",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "streamable-http",// The transport type of the MCP proxy server, can be `streamable-http`, `sse`. By default, it is `sse`.
    "options": {
      "panicIfInvalid": false,
      "logEnabled": true,
      "authTokens": [
        "DefaultTokens"
      ]
    }
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      },

          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-fetch"
      ],
      "options": {
        "panicIfInvalid": true,
        "logEnabled": false,
        "authTokens": [
          "SpecificTokens"
        ]
      }
    },
    "amap": {
      "url": "https://mcp.amap.com/sse?key=<YOUR_TOKEN>"
    }
  }
}
```

### **`options`**

Common options for `mcpProxy` and `mcpServers`.

- `panicIfInvalid`: If true, the server will panic if the client is invalid.
- `logEnabled`: If true, the server will log the client's requests.
- `authTokens`: A list of authentication tokens for the client. The `Authorization` header will be checked against this list.
- `toolFilter`: Optional tool filtering configuration. **This configuration is only effective in `mcpServers`.**
  - `mode`: Specifies the filtering mode. Must be explicitly set to `allow` or `block` if `list` is provided. If `list` is present but `mode` is missing or invalid, the filter will be ignored for this server.
  - `list`: A list of tool names to filter (either allow or block based on the `mode`).
  > **Tip:** If you don't know the exact tool names, run the proxy once without any `toolFilter` configured. The console will log messages like `<server_name> Adding tool <tool_name>` for each successfully registered tool. You can use these logged names in your `toolFilter` list.

> In the new configuration, the `authTokens` of `mcpProxy` is not a global authentication token, but rather the default authentication token for `mcpProxy`. When `authTokens` is set in `mcpServers`, the value of `authTokens` in `mcpServers` will be used instead of the value in `mcpProxy`. In other words, the `authTokens` of `mcpProxy` serves as a default value and is only applied when `authTokens` is not set in `mcpServers`. Other fields are the same.

### **`mcpProxy`**

Proxy HTTP server configuration

- `baseURL`: The public accessible URL of the server. This is used to generate the URLs for the clients.
- `addr`: The address the server listens on.
- `name`: The name of the server.
- `version`: The version of the server.
- `type`: The transport type of the MCP proxy server. Can be `streamable-http` or `sse`. By default, it is `sse`.
  - `streamable-http`: The MCP proxy server supports HTTP streaming.
  - `sse`: The MCP proxy server supports Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- `options`: Default options for the `mcpServers`.

### **`mcpServers`**

MCP server configuration, Adopt the same configuration format as other MCP Clients.

- `transportType`: The transport type of the MCP client. Except for `streamable-http`, which requires manual configuration, the rest will be automatically configured according to the content of the configuration file.
  - `stdio`: The MCP client is a command line tool that is run in a subprocess.
  - `sse`: The MCP client is a server that supports SSE (Server-Sent Events).
  - `streamable-http`: The MCP client is a server that supports HTTP streaming.

For stdio mcp servers, the `command` field is required.

- `command`: The command to run the MCP client.
- `args`: The arguments to pass to the command.
- `env`: The environment variables to set for the command.
- `options`: Options specific to the client.

For sse mcp servers, the `url` field is required. When the current `url` exists, `sse` will be automatically configured.

- `url`: The URL of the MCP client.
- `headers`: The headers to send with the request to the MCP client.

For http streaming mcp servers, the `url` field is required. and `transportType` need to manually set to `streamable-http`.

- `url`: The URL of the MCP client.
- `headers`: The headers to send with the request to the MCP client.
- `timeout`: The timeout for the request to the MCP client.

## Usage

```bash
Usage of mcp-proxy:
  -config string
        path to config file or a http(s) url (default "config.json")
  -help
        print help and exit
  -version
        print version and exit
```

1. The server will start and aggregate the tools and capabilities of the configured MCP clients.
2. When MCP Server type is `sse`, You can access the server at `http(s)://{baseURL}/{clientName}/sse`. (e.g., `https://mcp.example.com/fetch/sse`, based on the example configuration)
3. When MCP Server type is `streamable-http`, You can access the server at `http(s)://{baseURL}/{clientName}/mcp`. (e.g., `https://mcp.example.com/fetch/mcp`, based on the example configuration)
4. If your MCP client does not support custom request headers., you can change the key in `clients` such as `fetch` to `fetch/{authToken}`, and then access it via `fetch/{authToken}`.
