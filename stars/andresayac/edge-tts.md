# Edge TTS

**Edge TTS** is a powerful Text-to-Speech (TTS) package that leverages Microsoft's Edge capabilities. This package allows you to synthesize speech from text and manage voice options easily through a command-line interface (CLI).

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert text into natural-sounding speech using Microsoft Edge's TTS capabilities.
- **Multiple Voices**: Access a variety of voices to suit your project's needs.
- **Audio Export Options**: Export synthesized audio in different formats (raw, base64, or directly to a file).
- **Command-Line Interface**: Use a simple CLI for easy access to functionality.
- **Easy Integration**: Modular structure allows for easy inclusion in existing projects.

## Installation

You can install Edge TTS via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bun add @andresaya/edge-tts
```
```bash
npm install @andresaya/edge-tts
```


## Usage
Command-Line Interface

You can install Edge TTS via npm. bun  Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @andresaya/edge-tts
```

To synthesize speech from text, use the following command:
```bash
edge-tts synthesize -t "Hello, world!" -o hello_world_audio
```

To list available voices, run:

```bash
edge-tts voice-list
```

Integration into Your Project
To use Edge TTS in your Bun project, you can import it like this:

```js
import { EdgeTTS } from '@andresaya/edge-tts';

// Initialize the EdgeTTS service
const tts = new EdgeTTS();

// Get voices
const voices = await tts.getVoices();  
console.log(voices);  // Display available voices

// Synthesize text with options for voice, rate, volume, and pitch
await tts.synthesize("Hello, world!", 'en-US-AriaNeural', {
    rate: '0%',       // Speech rate (range: -100% to 100%)
    volume: '0%',     // Speech volume (range: -100% to 100%)
    pitch: '0Hz'      // Voice pitch (range: -100Hz to 100Hz)
});

// Export synthesized audio in different formats
tts.toBase64();   // Get audio as base64
await tts.toFile("output_audio");       // Save audio to file
await tts.toRaw();         // Get raw audio buffer
```

## Export Options
After synthesizing speech, you can export the audio in various formats:

- `toBase64`: Returns the audio as a Base64 string.
- `toFile`: Saves the audio to a specified file (e.g., "output.wav").
- `toRaw`: Returns the raw audio stream.
