## What is Mail0.io?

Mail0.io is an open-source email solution that gives users the power to **self-host** their own email app while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to put **control, privacy, and customization** back into the hands of users—whether they choose to host their email independently or manage multiple inboxes from a single, customizable platform.

## Why Mail0.io?

Most email services today are either **closed-source**, **data-hungry**, or **too complex to self-host**. Mail0.io is different:

✅ **Fully Open-Source** – No hidden agendas, no walled gardens. 100% transparency.
🔒 **Data Privacy First** – Your emails, your data. No tracking, no selling, no middlemen.
⚙️ **Self-Hosting Freedom** – Run your own email app with ease.
📬 **Unified Inbox** – Connect multiple email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and more.
🎨 **Customizable UI & Features** – Tailor your email experience the way you want it.
🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.

## Our Mission

We believe email should be:

1. **Yours** – You control where your data is stored.
2. **Flexible** – Use it however you want—self-hosted or connected to third-party providers.
3. **Open** – Transparent development, open collaboration, and community-driven innovation.
4. **User-Friendly** – No need for technical expertise to get started.

🤍 **Mail0.io – Email, Reimagined.**

## Tech Stack

Mail0.io is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth, Google OAuth
<!-- - **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Required Versions:**

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.0.0
- Docker >= 20.10.0

Before running the application, you'll need to set up several services and environment variables:

1. **Setup Local Services with Dev Container and Docker**

   - Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.
   - Open codebase as a container in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your favorite VSCode fork.
   - Run the following commands in order to populate your dependencies and setup docker

     ```
     pnpm install
     pnpm docker:up
     ```

   - Run the following commands to clean up after yourself

     ```
     pnpm docker:down
     rm -rf node_modules
     rm pnpm-lock.yaml
     ```

   - Run the following commands if you are unable to start any of the services

     ```
     rm -rf node_modules
     rm pnpm-lock.yaml
     ```

2. **Better Auth Setup**

   - Open the `.env` file and change the BETTER_AUTH_SECRET to a random string. (Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a 32 character string)

     ```env
     BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
     ```

3. **Google OAuth Setup**

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Add the following APIs in your Google Cloud Project: [People API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/people.googleapis.com), [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
     - Use the links above and click 'Enable' or
     - Go to 'APIs and Services' > 'Enable APIs and Services' > Search for 'Google People API' and click 'Enable'
     - Go to 'APIs and Services' > 'Enable APIs and Services' > Search for 'Gmail API' and click 'Enable'
   - Enable the Google OAuth2 API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - Development:
       - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
       - `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mail/auth/google/callback`
     - Production:
       - `https://your-production-url/api/auth/callback/google`
       - `https://your-production-url/api/v1/mail/auth/google/callback`
   - Add to `.env`:

     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mail/auth/google/callback
     ```

   - Add yourself as a test user:

     - Go to [`Audience`](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)
     - Under 'Test users' click 'Add Users'
     - Add your email and click 'Save'

> [!WARNING]
> The `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` must match **exactly** what you configure in the Google Cloud Console, including the protocol (http/https), domain, and path - these are provided above.

4. **GitHub OAuth Setup**

   - Go to [GitHub Developer Setting](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Create a new OAuth App
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:

     - Development:
       - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
     - Production:
       - `https://your-production-url/api/auth/callback/github`

   - Add to `.env`:

     ```env
     GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     ```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following variables:

```env
# Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=     # Required: Secret key for authentication

# Google OAuth (Optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=       # Required for Gmail integration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=   # Required for Gmail integration
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=    # Required for Gmail integration

# Database
DATABASE_URL=          # Required: PostgreSQL connection string
```

### Update the PostgreSQL database accordingly

Drizzle will apply the schema migrations set in `.env`

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

- Use `pnpm db:studio` to view and manage your data

### Running Locally

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Contribute

1. You can fork the repository and make changes to your forked repository. Once you have made your changes, you can create a pull request to the main branch.
2. To add code to the main branch, make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). **Your code will always be reviewed by a maintainer, not yourself!**

## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/nizzyabi/Mail0/issues/new?template=Blank+issue).

### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/nizzyabi/Mail0/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. For more information, see "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)". As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a reviewer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork and then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, check out this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
